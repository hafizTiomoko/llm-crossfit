{"4": "UNDERSTANDING CROSSFIT\nOriginally published in April 2007.\nThe aims, prescription, methodology, implementation, and adaptations of Cross-\nFit are collectively and individually unique, defining of CrossFit, and instrumental\nin our program\u2019s successes in diverse applications.\nAIMS\nFrom the beginning, the aim of CrossFit has been to forge a broad, general, and in-\nclusive fitness. We sought to build a program that would best prepare trainees for\nany physical contingency\u2014prepare them not only for the unknown but for the un-\nknowable. Looking at all sport and physical tasks collectively, we asked what physi-\ncal skills and adaptations would most universally lend themselves to performance\nadvantage. Capacity culled from the intersection of all sports demands would\nquite logically lend itself well to all sport. In sum, our specialty is not specializing.\nPRESCRIPTION\nCrossFit is: \u201cconstantly varied, high-intensity functional movement.\u201d This is our\nprescription. Functional movements are universal motor recruitment patterns;\nthey are performed in a wave of contraction from core to extremity; and they are\ncompound movements\u2014i.e., they are multi-joint. They are natural, effective, and\nefficient locomotors of body and external objects. But no aspect of functional\nmovements is more important than their capacity to move large loads over long\ndistances, and to do so quickly. Collectively, these three attributes (load, distance,\nand speed) uniquely qualify functional movements for the production of high pow-\ner. Intensity is defined exactly as power, and intensity is the independent variable\nmost commonly associated with maximizing the rate of return of favorable adap-\ntation to exercise. Recognizing that the breadth and depth of a program\u2019s stimulus\nwill determine the breadth and depth of the adaptation it elicits, our prescription\nof functionality and intensity is constantly varied. We believe that preparation for\nrandom physical challenges\u2014i.e., unknown and unknowable events\u2014is at odds\nwith fixed, predictable, and routine regimens."}
{"5": "METHODOLOGY\nThe methodology that drives CrossFit is entirely empirical. We believe that mean-\ningful statements about safety, efficacy, and efficiency, the three most important\nand interdependent facets to evaluate any fitness program, can be supported only\nby measurable, observable, repeatable data. We call this approach \u201cevidence-based\nfitness.\u201d CrossFit\u2019s methodology depends on full disclosure of methods, results,\nand criticisms, and we have employed the internet to support these values. Our\ncharter is open source, making co-developers out of participating coaches, ath-\nletes, and trainers through a spontaneous and collaborative online community.\nCrossFit is empirically driven, clinically tested, and community developed.\nIMPLEMENTATION We\u2019ve take\nIn implementation, CrossFit is, quite simply, a sport\u2014the Sport of Fitness.

The late Col.\nworkouts a\nJeff Cooper observed that \u201cthe fear of sporting failure is worse than the fear of\ndeath.\u201d It is our observation that men will die for points. Using whiteboards as distilled lo\nscoreboards, keeping accurate scores and records, running a clock, and precisely\nof motion,\ndefining the rules and standards for performance, we not only motivate unprece-\npower, wo\ndented output but derive both relative and absolute metrics at every workout; this\ndata has important value well beyond motivation. of action, fl\nspeed, and\nADAPTATIONS\npertinent m\nOur commitment to evidence-based fitness, publicly posting performance data,\nco-developing our program in collaboration with other coaches, and our open- to a single\nsource charter in general have well positioned us to garner important lessons from usually tim\nour program\u2014to learn precisely and accurately, that is, about the adaptations elic-\nthe Sport o\nited by CrossFit programming.

This is a discovery of great import and has come to motivate our program-\n\u2014COACH GLA\nming and refocus our efforts. This far-reaching increase in work capacity supports\nour initially stated aims of building a broad, general, and inclusive fitness program.\nIt also explains the wide variety of sport demands met by CrossFit, as evidenced"}

{"8": "Aside from the breadth or totality of fitness CrossFit seeks, our program is dis-\ntinctive, if not unique, in its focus on maximizing neuroendocrine response, de-\nveloping power, cross-training with multiple training modalities, constant training\nand practice with functional movements, and the development of successful\ndiet strategies.\nOur athletes are trained to bike, run, swim, and row at short, middle, and long\ndistances, guaranteeing exposure and competency in each of the three main met-\nabolic pathways.\nWe train our athletes in gymnastics from rudimentary to advanced movements,\ngarnering great capacity at controlling the body both dynamically and statically\nwhile maximizing strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility. We also place a heavy\nemphasis on Olympic weightlifting, having seen this sport\u2019s unique ability to devel-\nop an athlete\u2019s explosive power, control of external objects, and mastery of critical\nmotor recruitment patterns. And finally we encourage and assist our athletes to\nexplore a variety of sports as a vehicle to express and apply their fitness.\nAN EFFECTIVE APPROACH\nIn gyms and health clubs throughout the world the typical workout consists of\nisolation movements and extended aerobic sessions. The fitness community from\ntrainers to the magazines has the exercising public believing that lateral raises,\ncurls, leg extensions, sit-ups and the like combined with 20- to 40-minute stints on\nthe stationary bike or treadmill are going to lead to some kind of great fitness. Well,\nat CrossFit we work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high-in-\ntensity cardiovascular sessions. We have replaced the lateral raise with the push\npress, the curl with the pull-up, and the leg extension with the squat. For every\nlong-distance effort our athletes will do five or six at short distance. Why? Because\nfunctional movements and high intensity are radically more effective at eliciting\nnearly any desired fitness result. Startlingly, this is not a matter of opinion but\nsolid, irrefutable scientific fact, and yet the marginally effective old ways persist\nand are nearly universal. Our approach is consistent with what is practiced in elite"}
{"9": "training programs associated with major university athletic teams and profession-\nal sports. CrossFit endeavors to bring state-of-the-art coaching techniques to the\ngeneral public and athlete.\nIS THIS FOR ME?\nAbsolutely! Your needs and the Olympic athlete\u2019s differ by degree not kind. In-\ncreased power, speed, strength, cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, flexibility,\nstamina, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy are each important to the\nworld\u2019s best athletes and to our grandparents. The amazing truth is that the very\nsame methods that elicit optimal response in the Olympic or professional athlete\nwill optimize the same response in the elderly. Of course, we cannot load your\ngrandmother with the same squatting weight that we would assign an Olympic\nskier, but they both need to squat. In fact, squatting is essential to maintaining\nfunctional independence and improving fitness. Squatting is just one example\nof a movement that is universally valuable and essential yet rarely taught to any\nbut the most advanced of athletes. This is a tragedy. Through painstakingly thor-\nough coaching and incremental load assignment, CrossFit has been able to teach\neveryone who can care for himself or herself to perform safe-\nly and with maximum efficacy the same movements typically\nutilized by professional coaches in elite and certainly exclusive\nenvironments.\nWHO HAS BENEFITED FROM CROSSFIT?\nMany professional and elite athletes are participating in CrossFit.\nPrizefighters, cyclists, surfers, skiers, tennis players, triathletes\nand others competing at the highest levels are using CrossFit to\nadvance their core strength and conditioning, but that is not all.\nCrossFit has tested its methods on the sedentary, overweight,\npathological, and elderly and found that these special popula-\ntions met the same success as our stable of athletes. We call this\n\u201cbracketing.\u201d If our program works for Olympic skiers and over-\nweight, sedentary homemakers then it will work for you."}
{"10": "JUST WHAT IS A \u201cCORE STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING\u201d PROGRAM?\nCrossFit is a core strength and conditioning program in two distinct senses. First,\nwe are a core strength and conditioning program in the sense that the fitness\nwe develop is foundational to all other athletic\nneeds. This is the same sense in which the uni-\nversity courses required of a particular major\nare called the \u201ccore curriculum.\u201d This is the stuff\nthat everyone needs. Second, we are a \u201ccore\u201d\nstrength and conditioning program in the literal\nsense meaning the center of something. Much\nof our work focuses on the major functional axis\nof the human body, the extension and flexion\nof the hips and torso or trunk. The primacy of\ncore strength and conditioning in this sense is\nsupported by the simple observation that pow-\nerful hip extension alone is necessary and near-\nly sufficient for elite athletic performance. That\nis, our experience has been that no one without\nthe capacity for powerful hip extension enjoys\ngreat athletic prowess and nearly everyone we\nhave met with that capacity was a great athlete.\nRunning, jumping, punching, and throwing all\noriginate at the core. At CrossFit we endeavor\nto develop our athletes from the inside out, from core to extremity, which is, by\nthe way, how good functional movements recruit muscle, from the core to the\nextremities.\nCAN I ENJOY OPTIMAL HEALTH WITHOUT BEING AN ATHLETE?\nNo! Athletes experience a protection from the ravages of aging and disease that\nnon-athletes never find. For instance, 80-year-old athletes are stronger than\nnon-athletes in their prime at 25 years old. If you think that strength is not import-\nant, consider that strength loss is what puts people in nursing homes. Athletes\nhave greater bone density, stronger immune systems, less coronary heart dis-"}
{"11": "WHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO BE AN ATHLETE; I JUST WANT TO BE HEALTHY?\nYou are in luck. We hear this often, but the truth is that fitness, wellness, and pa-\nthology (sickness) are measures of the same entity: your health. There are a mul-\ntitude of measurable parameters that can be ordered from sick (pathological) to\nwell (normal) to fit (better than normal). These include but are not limited to blood\npressure, cholesterol, heart rate, body fat, muscle mass, flexibility, and strength.\nIt seems as though all of the body functions that can go awry have states that are\npathological, normal, and exceptional and that elite athletes typically show these\nparameters in the exceptional range. CrossFit\u2019s view is that fitness and health are\nthe same thing (see \u201cWhat Is Fitness? (Part 1)\u201d article). It is also interesting to notice\nthat the health professional maintains your health with drugs and surgery, each\nwith potentially undesirable side effects, whereas the CrossFit trainer typically\nachieves a superior result always with \u201cside benefit\u201d versus side effect.\nEXAMPLES OF CROSSFIT EXERCISES\nBiking, running, swimming, and rowing in an endless variety of drills. The clean and\njerk, snatch, squat, deadlift, push press, bench press, and power clean. Jumping,\nmedicine-ball throws and catches, pull-ups, dips, push-ups, handstands, presses\nto handstands, pirouettes, kips, cartwheels, muscle-ups, sit-ups, scales, and holds.\nWe make regular use of bikes, the track, rowing shells and ergometers, Olympic\nweight sets, rings, parallel bars, free exercise mats, horizontal bars, plyometrics\nboxes, medicine balls, and jump ropes.\nThere is not a strength and conditioning program anywhere that works with a\ngreater diversity of tools, modalities, and drills.\nWHAT IF I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF THIS?\nIt is a common sentiment to feel that because of the obligations of career and fami-\nly that you do not have the time to become as fit as you might like. Here is the good\nnews: World-class age group strength and conditioning is obtainable through an\nhour a day six days per week of training. It turns out that the intensity of training\nthat optimizes physical conditioning is not sustainable past 45 minutes to an hour.\nAthletes who train for hours a day are developing skill or training for sports that in-"}
{"12": "physical skills (cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, flexibility, strength,\npower, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy). The excessive aero-\nbic volume of the endurance athletes\u2019 training costs them in speed, power, and\nstrength to the point that their athletic competency has been compromised. No\ntriathlete is in ideal shape to wrestle, box, pole-vault, sprint, play any ball sport,\nfight fires, or do police work. Each of these requires a fitness level far beyond the\nneeds of the endurance athlete. None of this suggests that being a marathoner,\ntriathlete or other endurance athlete is a bad thing; just do not believe that training\nas a long-distance athlete gives you the fitness that is prerequisite to many sports.\nCrossFit considers the sumo wrestler, triathlete, marathoner, and powerlifter to\nbe \u201cfringe athletes\u201d in that their fitness demands are so specialized as to be incon-\nsistent with the adaptations that give maximum competency at all physical chal-\nlenges. Elite strength and conditioning is a compromise between each of the 10\nphysical adaptations. Endurance athletes do not balance that compromise.\nAEROBICS AND ANAEROBICS\nThere are three main energy systems that fuel all human activity. Almost all chang-\nes that occur in the body due to exercise are related to the demands placed on\nthese energy systems. Furthermore, the efficacy of any given fitness regimen may\nlargely be tied to its ability to elicit an adequate stimulus for change within these\nthree energy systems.\nEnergy is derived aerobically when oxygen is utilized to metabolize substrates de-\nrived from food and liberates energy. An activity is termed aerobic when the ma-\njority of energy needed is derived aerobically. These activities are usually greater\nthan 90 seconds in duration and involve low to moderate power output or inten-\nsity. Examples of aerobic activity include running on the treadmill for 20 minutes,\nswimming a mile, and watching TV.\nEnergy is derived anaerobically when energy is liberated from substrates in the\nabsence of oxygen. Activities are considered anaerobic when the majority of the\nenergy needed is derived anaerobically. In fact, properly structured, anaerobic ac-\ntivity can be used to develop a very high level of aerobic fitness without the muscle"}
{"13": "It warrants mention that in any activity all three energy systems are utilized\nthough one may dominate. The interplay of these systems can be complex, yet a\nsimple examination of the characteristics of aerobic versus anaerobic training can\nprove useful.\nCrossFit\u2019s approach is to judiciously balance anaerobic and aerobic exercise in a\nmanner that is consistent with the athlete\u2019s goals. Our exercise prescriptions ad-\nhere to proper specificity, progression, variation, and recovery to optimize\nadaptations.\nTHE OLYMPIC LIFTS, A.K.A., WEIGHTLIFTING\nThere are two Olympic lifts, the clean and jerk and\nthe snatch. Mastery of these lifts develops the\nsquat, deadlift, power clean, and split jerk while\nintegrating them into a single movement of un-\nequaled value in all of strength and conditioning.\nThe Olympic lifters are without a doubt the world\u2019s\nstrongest athletes.\nThese lifts train athletes to effectively activate more\nmuscle fibers more rapidly than through any other\nmodality of training. The explosiveness that results\nfrom this training is of vital necessity to every sport.\nPracticing the Olympic lifts teaches one to apply\nforce to muscle groups in proper sequence; i.e.,\nfrom the center of the body to its extremities (core\nto extremity). Learning this vital technical lesson benefits all athletes who need\nto impart force to another person or object, as is commonly required in near-\nly all sports.\nIn addition to learning to impart explosive forces, the clean and jerk and snatch\ncondition the body to receive such forces from another moving body both safely"}
{"14": "GYMNASTICS\nThe extraordinary value of gymnastics as a training modality lies in its reliance on\nthe body\u2019s own weight as the sole source of resistance. This places a unique premi-\num on the improvement of strength-to-weight ratio. Unlike other strength training\nmodalities, gymnastics and calisthenics allow for increases in strength only while\nincreasing strength-to-weight ratio!\nGymnastics develops pull-ups, squats, lunges, jumping, push-ups, and numerous\npresses to handstand, scales, and holds. These skills are unrivaled in their benefit\nto the physique, as evident in any competitive gymnast.\nAs important as the capacity of this modality is for strength development, it is with-\nout a doubt the ultimate approach to improving coordination, balance, agility, ac-\ncuracy, and flexibility. Through the use of numerous presses, handstands, scales,\nand other floor work, the gymnast\u2019s training greatly enhances kinesthetic sense.\nThe variety of movements available for inclusion in this modality probably exceeds\nthe number of exercises known to all non-gymnastic sport! The rich variety here\ncontributes substantially to CrossFit\u2019s ability to inspire great athletic confidence\nand prowess.\nFor a combination of strength, flexibility, well-developed physique, coordina-\ntion, balance, accuracy, and agility, the gymnast has no equal in the sports world.\nThe inclusion of this training modality is absurdly absent from nearly all train-\ning programs.\nROUTINES\nThere is no ideal routine! In fact, the chief value of any routine lies in abandon-\ning it for another. The CrossFit ideal is to train for any contingency. The obvious\nimplication is that this is possible only if there is a tremendously varied quality to\nthe breadth of stimulus. It is in this sense that CrossFit is a core strength and con-\nditioning program. Anything else is sport-specific training, not core strength and\nconditioning."}

Most important adaptations to exercise are in part or\ncompletely a result of a hormonal or neurological shift. Research has shown which\nexercise protocols maximize neuroendocrine responses. Earlier we faulted isola-\ntion movements as being ineffectual. Now we can tell you that one of the critical\nelements missing from these movements is that they invoke essentially no neuro-\nendocrine response.\nAmong the hormonal responses vital to athletic development are substantial\nincreases in testosterone, insulin-like growth factor, and human growth hor-\nmone.

{"18": "WHAT SHOULD I EAT?\nIn plain language, base your diet on garden vegetables (especially greens), meats,\nnuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar. That is about as simple as we\ncan get. Many have observed that keeping your grocery cart to the perimeter of the\ngrocery store while avoiding the aisles is a great way to protect your health. Food\nis perishable. The stuff with long shelf life is all suspect. If you follow these simple\nguidelines, you will benefit from nearly all that can be achieved through nutrition.\nTHE CAVEMAN OR PALEOLITHIC MODEL FOR NUTRITION\nModern diets are ill suited for our genetic composition. Evolution has not kept pace\nwith advances in agriculture and food processing, resulting in a plague of health\nproblems for modern man. Coronary heart disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoporo-\nsis, obesity, and psychological dysfunction have all been scientifically linked to a\ndiet too high in refined or processed carbohydrate. The caveman model is perfect-\nly consistent with CrossFit\u2019s prescription.\nWHAT FOODS SHOULD I AVOID?\nExcessive consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates is the primary culprit in\nnutritionally caused health problems. High-glycemic carbohydrates are those that\nraise blood sugar too rapidly. They include rice, bread, candy, potato, sweets, so-\ndas, and most processed carbohydrates. Processing can include bleaching, bak-\ning, grinding, and refining. Processing of carbohydrates greatly increases their\nglycemic index, a measure of their propensity to elevate blood sugar.\nWHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH HIGH-GLYCEMIC CARBOHYDRATES?\nThe problem with high-glycemic carbohydrates is that in excess they give an inor-\ndinate insulin response. Insulin is an essential hormone for life, yet acute, chron-\nic elevation of insulin leads to hyperinsulinism, which has been positively linked\nto obesity, elevated cholesterol levels, blood pressure, mood dysfunction, and a\nPandora\u2019s box of disease and disability.

But, where sports develop and require all 10\ngeneral skills simultaneously, they do so slowly compared to our strength and con-\nditioning regimen.

There is more opportunity of advancing athletic performance via\nadvancing GPP than there is in more sport-specific strength and conditioning\ntraining. For example, I am not sure why more pull-ups make for better skiers,\nbut they do. We have some theories why that occurs, but we do not actually need\nto know the mechanism. We are focused on advancing performance.\nSo the second model is a statistical model using skills and drills. I am looking for a\nbalance of capacity across training modalities.\nThe third model uses the three metabolic pathways. These are the three engines\nthat produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the currency of effort of all energy\noutput. Power is plotted on the Y-axis and duration of effort (time) on the X-axis.\nThe first pathway (phosphagen or phosphocreatine) is high powered and short\nduration. It can account for about 100 percent of max human output and taps out\nat about 10 seconds. The second pathway (lactate or glycolytic) is moderate pow-\nered, moderate duration. It accounts for approximately 70 percent of max pow-\ner output, peaks at about 60 seconds and terminates at 120 seconds. The third\npathway (oxidative or aerobic) is low powered, long duration. It accounts for ap-\nproximately 40 percent of max power output and does not fade in any reasonable\ntime for which I have the patience to measure. The phosphagen and the glycolytic\npathways are anaerobic; oxidative is aerobic. All three engines work all the time to\nsome extent. The degree to which each is active is dependent on the activity. One\nidles, while the other two rev; two will rev, one will idle, etc.\nOur thought is this: He or she is as fit as he or she is balanced in capacity in all\nthree of these engines. A human being is a vehicle with three engines. Suppose we\ndiscover there is a fourth engine; we want capacity there, too. We develop capacity\nin all engines through our prescription: constantly varied functional movement\nexecuted at high intensity.

{"42": "TECHNIQUE\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s Dec. 1, 2007, L1 lecture in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nIn no small part, what is behind this program is the quantification of fitness. This\nmeans we put a number on fitness: work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains. You can assess one\u2019s fitness by determining the area under his or her\nwork-capacity curve. This would be similar to a group of athletes competing in 25\nto 30 workouts. Include a range of activities\u2014like three pulls on the Concept2 row-\ner for average watts to a 10-mile run\u2014and a multitude of workouts in between.\nCompile their overall placing across these events, and everyone then has a reason-\nable metric of his or her total capacity.\nThis quantification of fitness is a part of a broader concept that is at the heart of\nthis movement: We call it evidence-based fitness. This means measurable, observ-\nable, repeatable data is used in analyzing and assessing a fitness program. There\nare three meaningful components to analysis of a fitness program: safety, efficacy,\nand efficiency.\nThe efficacy of a program means, \u201cWhat is the return?\u201d Maybe a fitness program\nadvertises that it will make you a better soccer player. There needs to be evidence\nof this supported by measurable, observable, repeatable data. For CrossFit, we\nwant to increase your work capacity across broad time and modal domains. This is\nthe efficacy of this program. What are the tangible results? What is the adaptation\nthat the program induces?\nEfficiency is the time rate of that adaptation. Maybe the fitness program adver-\ntises that it can deliver 50 pull-ups. There is a big difference whether it takes six\nmonths versus nine years to achieve that.\nSafety is how many people end up at the finish line. Suppose I have a fitness pro-\ngram.

{"43": "For the qualification of movement there are four common terms: mechanics,\ntechnique, form and style. I will not delve into them with too much detail: The\ndistinction is not that important. I use both technique and form somewhat inter-\nchangeably, although there is a slightly nuanced distinction.\nWhen I talk about angular velocity, momentum, leverage, origin or insertion of\nmuscles, torque, force, power, relative angles, we are taking about mechanics.\nWhen I speak to the physics of movement, and especially the statics and less so\nthe dynamics, I am looking at the mechanics.\nTechnique is the method to success for completion of a movement. For example, if\nyou want to do a full twisting dismount on the rings, the technique would be: pull,\nlet go, look, arm up, turn, shoulder drop, etc. Technique includes head posture and\nbody posture. And there are effective and less effective techniques. Technique\nincludes the mechanics, but it is in the macro sense of \u201chow do you complete the\nmovement without the physics?\u201d\nForm is the normative value: This is good or this is bad\u2014\u201cyou should\u201d or \u201cyou\nshouldn\u2019t\u201d applied to mechanics and technique.\nStyle is essentially the signature to a movement; that is, that aspect of the move-\nment that is fairly unique to you. The best of the weightlifting coaches can look at\nthe bar path during a lift and tell you which lifter it is. There are aspects to all of our\nmovements that define us like your thumbprint. It is the signature. To be truly just\nthe signature, style elements have no bearing on form, technique or mechanics.\nStyle does not enter into the normative assessment, is not important to technique,\nand does not alter substantially the physics.\nThese four terms are all qualifications to movement. I want to speak generally to\ntechnique and form to include all of this, but what we are talking about here is the\nnon-quantification of output; that is, how you move.\nBy taking power or work capacity as our primary value for assessing technique\u2014"}

For example, you can use an\nelectromyogram and see with what force the biceps shortens. If you are defining\nstrength as contractile potential, you may end up with the guy with enormous\ncontractile potential\u2014but not knowing the technique of the clean, the jerk, the\ndeadlift, he cannot do as much work.\nWe, however, do not take contractile potential as the gold standard for strength.\nStrength is the productive application of force. If you cannot complete work, if you\ncannot express strength as power, if strength cannot be expressed as productive\nresult, it does not count. Having enormous biceps and quadriceps is useless if you\ncannot run, jump, lift, throw, press.\nThis is related to safety, efficacy and efficiency because technique (quality of\nmovement) is the heart of maximizing each of these.\nHe or she who knows how to do these movements when confronted with them\nwill get a better result in terms of safety.

I want\nto look at typing, shooting, playing the violin, NASCAR driving and CrossFit. What\nthese domains have in common is that a marked proficiency is associated with\nspeed. Being able to shoot accurately and quickly is better than quickly or accurately.\nYou may try to get a job as a typist because you do not make any mistakes. How-\never, for this perfection, you type at a rate of 20 words a minute and only use two\nfingers. You will never get hired. Playing the violin fast and error-free is critical for\na virtuoso. However, someone who gets through \u201cFlight of the Bumblebee\u201d in 12\nminutes is not there yet. A NASCAR driver wants to both drive fast and not wreck.\nIn CrossFit, a perfectly exquisite Fran is worthless if it takes 32 minutes.\nAnd yet, it is presented to CrossFit coaches as, \u201cShould I use good form or should I\ndo it quickly?\u201d I do not like my choices. One is impossible without the other.\nTechnique and speed are not at odds with one another, where \u201cspeed\u201d is related\nto all the quantification of the movement: power, force, distance, time. They are\nseemingly at odds. It is a misapprehension. It is an illusion.\nCan you learn to drive fast without wrecking? Can you learn to type fast without\nmaking errors? Can you shoot quickly without missing? Eventually, but not in the\nlearning. One is impossible without the other.\nYou will not learn to type fast without typing where you make a ton of errors and\nthen work to reduce the errors at that speed. Then you go faster, and then again\npull the errors back in, then go faster and pull the errors back in. You drive faster\nand faster and then you spin out in the infield or you hit the wall.\nIf you are a race driver and you have never spun out, gone out in the infield or nev-\ner been in a wreck, you are not very good.

First, at that speed I want you to fix your tech-\nnique. What you need to do is continuously and constantly advance the margins\nat which form falters.\nIt may be that initially at 10,000 foot-pounds per minute my technique is perfect,\nbut it falls apart at 12,000 foot-pounds per minute. Work at that 10,000 to 12,000\nfoot-pounds per minute mark to fix the form, and soon enough you will have great\ntechnique at 12,000 foot-pounds per minute. The next step is to achieve that tech-\nnique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute.\nAt first, the technique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute will suffer. Then you must\nnarrow it in. That is the process. It is ineluctable. It is unavoidable. There is nothing\nI can do about it. That is not my rule.\nWe are the technique people. We drill technique incessantly, but simultaneously I\nwant you to go faster. You will learn to work at higher intensity with good technique\nonly by ratcheting up the intensity to a point where good technique is impossible.\nThis dichotomy means that it is impossible at the limits of your capacity to obey\nevery little detail and nuance of technique. Some of the refined motor-recruitment\npatterns are not going to always look perfect.\nI do not know of a domain where speed matters and technique is not at the heart\nof it. In every athletic endeavor where we can quantify the output, there is incred-\nible technique at the highest levels of performance.\nSuppose someone set the new world record for the shot put, but his technique was\npoor.

(Glu-\ncagon is the counter-regulatory hormone to insulin: It releases the energy out of\nthe cells.) And one of the things that insulin puts into cells is fat.\nYou can see that the way to get your insulin level too high (hyperinsulinism) is to\neat too much carbohydrate. How much carbohydrate is that? In the qualitative\nsense, your insulin level is \u201ctoo high\u201d if it is driving up your blood pressure, mak-\ning you fat or reducing your ability to suppress blood sugar after eating carbo-\nhydrate.

High-density lipoproteins (HDL\ncholesterol), for instance: At less than 35 mg/dL you have a problem, 50 mg/dL is\nnice, and 75 mg/dL is a whole lot better.

{"67": "TYPICAL CROSSFIT BLOCK PRESCRIPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS\nTo best understand the Zone Diet, CrossFit athletes should read Dr. Barry Sears\u2019\nbook \u201cEnter the Zone.\u201d This article gives more information regarding block pre-\nscriptions and fat adjustments for CrossFit athletes.\nThe chart based on sex and body type in the article \u201cZone Meal Plans\u201d is perfect\nfor those who want to start the Zone Diet. If the athlete chooses the wrong block\nsize and does not obtain the desired results, the plan can be modified after a few\nweeks. Errors in block selection might slow progress, but initial errors are offset by\nthe huge value in starting a practice of weighing and measuring intake.\nSears details a more precise method to calculate one\u2019s block prescription in \u201cEnter\nthe Zone.\u201d It is:\nZone block prescription = lean body mass (lb.) x activity level (g/lb. of lean\nbody mass) / 7 (g protein/block)\nThe activity level ranges on a scale of 0-1. For those who work out several days a\nweek and do not have a labor-intensive job, the activity level should be 0.7 (most\nCrossFit athletes). By dividing 0.7 by 7 g in the equation, this simplifies to a Zone\nblock prescription that is 10 percent of his or her lean mass.\nThe activity factor should increase if the athlete does CrossFit two or more times a\nday, trains for another sport in addition to CrossFit, or holds a strenuous daily job\n(e.g., construction, farming, etc., and potentially coaching, if on one\u2019s feet all day).\nAlthough CrossFit workouts are relatively intense, they are not long in duration.\nAn individual does not need to increase the activity level value based on intensity\nalone; activity volume determines activity factor.\nSAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE ZONE BLOCK PRESCRIPTION\nSuppose an athlete is 185 lb. (84 kg) with 16 percent body fat. He does CrossFit five\ndays per week and works in a typical office environment. A sample calculation of"}
{"68": "TABLE 1. MACRONUTRIENT AND CALORIE COMPOSITION\nFOR 15 BLOCKS A DAY\nProtein 15 blocks x 7 g = 105 g (420 calories)\nCarbohydrate 15 blocks x 9 g = 135 g (540 calories)\nFat 15 blocks x 3 g = 45 g (405 calories)\nTotal Calories = 1,365\nNote the total calories presented here are underestimated due to hidden calories.\nMost foods are classified by a single macronutrient, despite the presence of some\nother macronutrients (e.g., nuts are classified as a fat but have some protein and\ncarbohydrate calories). These less predominant macronutrients for each source\nare not included in the total calorie calculations.\nThis athlete could also choose to round up to 16 blocks, particularly if he or she is\nmore likely to have compliance issues. The Zone prescription is a calorie-restrictive\ndiet and can be especially difficult for new adopters. When one\u2019s calculation has a\ndecimal value, rounding up to the next whole block might result in slower progress\nbut produce better long-term compliance. Once the athlete has become accus-\ntomed to the diet, then the total blocks can be rounded down to 15, particularly if\ndesired body composition has not been achieved.\nINCREASING FAT INTAKE\nThe caloric restriction leans out the athlete while providing enough protein and\ncarbohydrate for typical CrossFit activity levels. However, the athlete can become\ntoo lean. The athlete is considered \u201ctoo lean\u201d when performance decreases in\ncombination with continued weight loss. \u201cToo lean\u201d should not be based on body\nweight or appearance alone. When a loss of mass coincides with a drop in perfor-\nmance, the athlete needs to add calories to the diet. This can be accomplished by\ndoubling the fat intake (Table 2)."}

{"70": "SUPPLEMENTATION\nWhole, unprocessed foods are the best source of both macronutrients and micro-\nnutrients in terms of composition, variety, and density, such that supplementation\nis generally not recommended. We contend that eating a diet composed of known\nquantities and of high-quality whole foods is the most important aspect of nutri-\ntion for improved performance and health. Not only are supplements generally\npoorer nutrient sources, but they are also an unnecessary focus for someone not\nfollowing our basic diet plan of weighed and measured meat and vegetables, etc.\nHowever, we find one supplement beneficial enough to make a blanket recom-\nmendation: fish oil. Fish oil provides omega-3 fatty acids, which are a type of poly-\nunsaturated fat.\nPhysiological fats are known as triglycerides in biological terms; they are composed\nof a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached (Figure 1). The attached fatty\nacids are mixtures of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats. Al-\nthough one fatty acid is prominent in each food, all three are represented to some\ndegree. Figure 2 provides a summary of the types of fat and example food sources.\nThe two types of polyunsaturated fats found most frequently in foods are ome-\nga-3 and omega-6 fats. Classifying a fatty acid as omega-3 versus omega-6 is\ndependent on chemical structure. Polyunsaturated fats are sources of the two\nessential fatty acids, meaning they must be obtained from the diet. They are al-\npha-linolenic acid (ALA) (an omega-3) and linoleic acid (LA) (an omega-6). Ome-\nga-3 fats are known as \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d fats, and omega-6 fats are known as\n\u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d fats based on their physiological functions. Both are needed\nin relatively equal quantities."}
{"71": "Figure 2. Summary of Fatty Acids and Example Food Sources."}
{"72": "Fish-oil supplementation improves the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids\nand reduces the inflammatory responses in the body. Fish oil provides two types\nof omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid\n(DHA), the form of omega-3 fats preferred by the brain and body. The body can\nconvert ALA to EPA and DHA, but the conversion process is inefficient. Some prac-\ntitioners have recommended a combined daily intake on the order of 3 grams of\nEPA and DHA for an otherwise healthy individual, although the exact amount is\ndictated by one\u2019s total omega-6 intake. Each brand of fish oil has a different con-\ncentration of EPA and DHA per serving as indicated on the label. Individuals might\nhave to take multiple servings to get 3 grams of EPA and DHA, as brands might\ninclude omega-3s that are neither EPA nor DHA (e.g., ALA). Flax seed or oil is not an\nappropriate supplement for omega-3s. Flax is a good source of ALA, but because\nof the poor conversion to EPA and DHA, it is not recommended. If the individual is\nvegan, DHA can be obtained with algae oil.\nResearch has indicated positive health benefits by supplementing with fish oil.\nOmega-3 fats help increase the fluidity of cell membranes, and research has in-\ndicated supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular function,\nnervous-system function, immune health, memory, and mood issues. Omega 3s\nalso function as an anti-coagulant, so military personnel should consider remov-\ning fish oil supplements from their diet a couple of weeks prior to deployment.\nIt might also be appropriate for those with an upcoming surgery to stop taking\nfish oil two weeks from that date. These individuals should talk with their doctor\nregarding these circumstances.\nIt is possible to avoid omega-3 supplementation depending on food intake, al-\nthough the individual needs to be fastidious with his or her diet. This could be\naccomplished by avoidance of all vegetable oils (which are used at most every\nrestaurant), and nuts and seeds. Meat would have to be grass-fed and eggs pas-\nture-raised, and wild-caught fish should be consumed a few times a week. Be-\ncause this is not practical for many people, supplementation is effective.\nBesides the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3s in the diet, the total amount of poly-"}

The monostructural\nmetabolic conditioning activities are commonly referred to as \u201ccardio,\u201d the pur-\npose of which is primarily to improve cardiorespiratory capacity and stamina.\nThey are repetitive, cyclical movements that could be sustained for long periods\nof time. The gymnastics modality comprises body-weight exercises/elements or\ncalisthenics, and its primary purpose is to improve body control by improving\nneurological components such as coordination, balance, agility, and accuracy, and\nto improve functional upper-body capacity and trunk strength. The weightlifting\nmodality comprises the most important weight-training basics, Olympic lifts and\npowerlifting, where the aim is primarily to increase strength, power, and hip/leg\ncapacity. This category includes any exercise with the addition of an external load.\nTable 2 gives the common exercises used by our program, separated by modality,\nin fleshing out the routines.\nFor metabolic conditioning the exercises are run, bike, row, and jump rope. The\ngymnastics modality includes air squats, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, handstand\npush-ups, rope climbs, muscle-ups, presses to handstands, back/hip extensions,\nsit-ups, and jumps (vertical, box, broad, etc.). The weightlifting modality includes\nTABLE 2. EXERCISES BY MODALITY"}
{"76": "deadlifts, cleans, presses, snatches, clean and jerks, medicine-ball drills and\nthrows, and kettlebell swings.\nThe elements, or exercises, chosen for each modality were selected for their\nfunctionality, neuroendocrine response, and overall capacity to dramatically and\nbroadly impact the human body.\nWORKOUT STRUCTURE\nThe workout structure varies by the inclusion of one, two, or three modalities for\neach day (Table 3). Days 1, 5, and 9 are each single-modality workouts whereas days\n2, 6, and 10 include two modalities each (couplets), and finally, days 3, 7, and 11 use\nthree modalities each (triplets). In every case each modality is represented by a\nsingle exercise or element; i.e., each M, W, and G represents a single exercise from\nmetabolic conditioning, weightlifting, and gymnastics modalities respectively.\nWhen the workout includes a single exercise (days 1, 5, and 9) the focus is on a\nsingle exercise or effort. When the element is the single \u201cM\u201d (day 1) the workout is\na single effort and is typically a long, slow, distance effort. When the modality is a\nsingle \u201cG\u201d (day 5) the workout is practice of a single skill, and typically this skill is\nsufficiently complex to require great practice but might not be yet suitable for in-\nclusion in a timed workout because performance is not yet adequate for efficient\ninclusion. When the modality is the single \u201cW\u201d (day 9) the workout is a single lift and\ntypically performed at high weight and low repetition. It is worth repeating that the\nfocus on days 1, 5, and 9 is single efforts of \u201ccardio\u201d at long distance; improving\nhigh-skill, more complex gymnastics movements; and single/low-rep heavy\nweightlifting basics, respectively. This is not the day to work sprints, pull-ups, or\nhigh-repetition clean and jerks \u2014the other days would be more appropriate.\nTABLE 3.

{"79": "SCALING CROSSFIT\nCrossFit workouts, and especially those on CrossFit.com, are designed to chal-\nlenge even the most advanced athlete. Many athletes need to \u201cscale\u201d (i.e., modify)\nthe workouts for the safest implementation of the program. Finding a CrossFit\naffiliate is one way to receive proper coaching and guidance through this pro-\ncess. In absence of an experienced trainer, this article presents some basic\nconcepts for scaling workouts particularly for beginners. Scaling for other pop-\nulations (e.g., advanced or injured athletes) is discussed in greater detail at the\nLevel 2 Certificate Course, as well as in the Online Scaling Course.\nAthletes will need to scale workouts for variable lengths of time. One\u2019s athletic\nbackground, as well as his or her current health and fitness capacity, dictates how\nlong scaling is necessary. The methodology presented here can be used indefi-\nnitely, but a month is the minimum period for which significant scaling should be\napplied. This introductory period serves two purposes: 1) it develops competency\nof movements used in CrossFit; and 2) it appropriately exposes the athlete to grad-\nual increases in intensity and volume.\nMECHANICS AND CONSISTENCY FIRST\nCrossFit\u2019s charter for creating the most optimal balance of safety, efficacy, and\nefficiency is: mechanics, consistency, then\u2014and only then\u2014intensity. The initial\nexposure to CrossFit is when movement mechanics should be prioritized over in-\ntensity. And for some, just practicing the movements will be intense. It is impera-\ntive that the movements can be performed correctly and consistently before load\nand speed are added. While intensity is an important part of the CrossFit program,\nit is added after movement proficiency is established. Ignoring this order increas-\nes the risk for injury and potentially blunts long-term progress, especially if poor\nmechanics are combined with load.\nSCALING EFFECTIVELY: PRESERVE THE STIMULUS\nWhen scaling workouts, the main principle to follow is \u201cpreserve the stimulus.\u201d"}
{"80": "Intensity and Volume\nTwo factors need to be scaled for every beginner: 1) intensity; and 2) volume. A\nprudent method for beginners is reducing intensity and/or volume by half for at\nleast two weeks. Depending on how the athlete progresses, volume and intensity\ncan be gradually increased in the following weeks, months, and years.\nIntensity refers to the amount of power an athlete generates. Intensity may be\nmodified in three ways: 1) load; 2) speed; and/or 3) volume.\nLoad is the variable to scale first; scaling the load is an easy way to preserve the\nstimulus relative to an athlete\u2019s capacity. Load is also the most common variable\nmodified after the beginner period. Especially for a conditioning workout, the ath-\nlete should use a load that ensures he or she is able to complete the first set or\nround without compromising form or reaching muscular failure. Determining ap-\npropriate loads for newer athletes requires some estimation, and scaling will not\nalways be perfect. Often, loads for newer athletes will be less than 50 percent\nof the prescribed load, especially if an athlete is new to lifting weights. Coaches\nshould err on the side of scaling too much rather than not enough, particularly for\nnewer athletes.\nSpeed tends to be more self-modulated due to the athlete\u2019s fitness level, although\na coach can modulate speed based on the mechanics demonstrated. A coach\nmight have to slow an athlete down to achieve the correct mechanics. Similarly,\ncoaches might have to encourage an athlete who is moving well to move faster,\nthough this is less common when working with beginners (see \u201cTechnique\u201d article).\nVolume is the total amount of work accomplished by the athlete. Depending on\nthe workout, volume can be lowered by reducing: 1) time; 2) reps/rounds; and/or\n3) distance.\nNewer CrossFit athletes might attempt to struggle through a workout where\nthe volume of repetitions (or load, above) is beyond their current capacity. For\nexample, an advanced CrossFit athlete might complete Fran in 2 minutes. That"}
{"81": "Movements\nWhen a movement cannot be performed at all, it can be substituted. CrossFit\nsuggests modifying this variable last because avoiding a movement prevents an\nindividual from developing proficiency in it. An athlete or trainer should first try re-\nducing the load before substituting the movement. If the workout calls for snatch-\nes at 95 lb., for example, it is generally preferable that the athlete performs the\nsnatches with a PVC pipe instead of substituting 95-lb. overhead squats.\nComplete movement substitutions should be considered when a physical limita-\ntion or injury is present, or when the load cannot be reduced. When selecting a\nsubstitute movement, trainers should try to preserve the original movement\u2019s\nfunction and range of motion as best they can. When determining movement sub-\nstitutions consider:\n1) Whether the movement is primarily driven by the lower body or\nupper body.\n2) The movement function (e.g., push versus pull).\n3) The range of motion used by the movement (specifically of the hips,\nknees, and ankles).\n4) The plane of movement.\nParticularly in the case of injury, a complete movement replacement might be nec-\nessary. Consideration of these variables can help trainers select a movement sub-\nstitution or replacement that is as similar as possible to the prescribed movement.\nA SAMPLE WEEK OF SCALING\nThis section outlines five typical CrossFit workouts. For each Workout of the Day\n(WOD), scaled workouts are presented with modifications to volume, load, and\nmovements. Some of the rationale for the options is also described. These scaled\nworkouts should be considered but three examples of the many options available.\nThey do not take the place of scaled workouts created by an experienced trainer\nwho is relying on intuition and detailed knowledge of a specific athlete."}

Doing so will allow the individual to achieve almost the same volume\nwhile he or she develops new skills and/or is exposed to heavier elements.\nCONCLUSION\nAthletes and their trainers should focus on movement proficiency before adding\nspeed and load.

As a matter of terminology, when we refer to the\n\u201csquat\u201d we are talking about an unladen, body-weight-only squat. When we wish\nto refer to a weighted squat we will use the term back squat, overhead squat, or\nfront squat, referring to those distinct weighted squats. Training with the front,\nback, and overhead squats before the weightless variant has been mastered re-\ntards athletic potential and compromises safety and efficacy.\nWhen has the squat been mastered? This is a good question. It is fair to say that\nthe squat is mastered when both technique and performance are superior. This\nsuggests that none of the points of performance are deficient and fast multiple\nreps are possible. Our favorite standard for fast multiple reps would be the Ta-\nbata squat (20 seconds on/10 seconds off repeated 8 times) with the weakest of\neight intervals being between 18 and 20 reps. Do not misunderstand \u2014we are\nlooking for 18-20 perfect squats in 20 seconds, rest for 10, and repeat seven\nmore times for a total of eight intervals.\nThe most common faults to look for are surrendering of the lumbar curve at the\nbottom, not breaking the parallel plane with the hips, slouching in the chest and\nshoulders, lifting the heels, and not fully extending the hip at the top (Figure 1).\nDo not even think about weighted squats until none of these faults belong to you.\nA relatively small angle of hip extension, while indicative of a beginner\u2019s or weak\nsquat and caused by weak hips extensors, is not strictly considered a fault as\nlong as the lumbar spine is neutral.\nCAUSES OF A BAD SQUAT\n1) Weak glute/hamstring. The glutes and hams are responsible for powerful\nhip extension, which is the key to the athletic performance universe.\n2) Poor engagement, weak control, and no awareness of glute and\nhamstring.

{"124": "SUMMARY\nFrom shoulder press to push jerk the movements become increasingly more ath-\nletic, functional, and suited to heavier loads. The progression also increasingly\nrelies on the power zone. In the shoulder press, the power zone is used for stabi-\nlization only. In the push press the power zone provides not only stability but also\nthe primary impetus in both the dip and drive. In the push jerk the power zone is\ncalled on for the dip, drive, second dip, and squat. The role of the hip is increased\nin each exercise.\nWith the push press you will be able to drive overhead as much as 30 percent more\nweight than with the shoulder press. The push jerk will allow you to drive as much\nas 30 percent more overhead than you would with the push press.\nIn effect the hip is increasingly recruited through the progression of lifts to assist\nthe arms and shoulders in raising loads overhead. After mastering the push jerk\nyou will find that it will unconsciously displace the push press as your method of\nchoice when going overhead.\nThe second dip on the push jerk will become lower and lower as you both master\nthe technique and increase the load. At some point in your development, the loads\nwill become so substantial that the upper body cannot contribute but a fraction\nto the movement, at which point the catch becomes very low and an increasing\namount of the lift is accomplished by the overhead squat.\nOn both the push press and jerk, the \u201cdip\u201d is critical to the entire movement. The\nstomach is held very tightly and the resultant turnaround from dip to drive is sud-\nden, explosive, and violent.\nTRY THESE\n1) Start with 95 lb. and push press or push jerk 15 straight repetitions, rest\n30 seconds, and repeat for total of 5 sets of 15 repetitions each. Go up\nin weight only when you can complete all 5 sets with only 30 seconds of\nrest between each and do not pause in any set."}

{"133": "THE GLUTE-HAM DEVELOPER (GHD)\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s March 18, 2007, L1 lecture in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nOur definition of core strength is midline stabilization. In profile, there is a ref-\nerence line that trisects the spine and bisects the pelvis. Midline stabilization is\nthe ability to maintain rigidity, stability, and a lack of deflection about that line\n(Figure 1). This translates to improved efficiency and performance and greater\npower output.\nIt is critical to the deadlift, to the laden squat, to the shoulder press, and to any\nsport. In a swimmer\u2019s stroke\u2014when the left leg kicks and right arm pulls\u2014if the\ntorso deviates to one side, you lose energy. Energy is lost in its deflection, wheth-\ner throwing a punch, riding a bicycle, or squatting. The abdominals, with the hip\nflexors, control one side of the torso, with the hip extensors and erectors involved\non the other side.\nHowever, what we have in modern physical culture is an excessive awareness\nand focus on the anterior and not on the posterior. As a culture of athletes and\nnon-athletes alike, we are unfortunately frontally fixated. Pecs\u2014what about the\nrhomboids? Abs\u2014what about the erectors? Quads\u2014what about the glute-ham-\nstring? And for the best of functional movement\u2014punch, jump, throw, run\u2014the\nimpetus comes out of the posterior.\nWe see communities where there is a very deliberate and concerted effort to min-\nimize hip-flexor involvement in exercise. And yet, by insertion and origin, by me-\nchanical position and advantage, and just kinematically, the hip flexors, have\nseveral times the contraction capacity that is estimated of the abdominals. All of it:\nhip extensors, hip flexors, trunk flexors, and ex-\ntensors are essential to midline stabilization. The\nabdominals are just one part of the story.\nFor core strength (midline stabilization), we are"}
{"134": "pelvis relationship. About the only thing that we see them paying attention to is\ndynamic trunk-flexion work. There is no trunk-extension work, no hip-extension\nwork, and hip flexion is deliberately limited. Some of these communities also have\nproblems with chronic back injury, which comes at no surprise. If there is anything\nto \u201cmuscle balance,\u201d it makes sense. In how many communities are they doing an\nequal number of deadlifts and squats to their sit-ups? Most of the military/law-en-\nforcement PT is completely devoid of full-range-of-motion hip extension. Rucking,\nrunning, jumping jacks\u2014all will not do it. The run, pull-up, sit-up, push-up, lath-\ner-rinse-repeat PT has no real good core movement. The crunch does not count.\nWhile a cumbersome and space-taking piece of gear, the GHD has been essential\nto our work. We have four of them in 2,500 square feet, so one every 600 feet.\nWe use the GHD for four exercises to heighten awareness and develop capacity\nat midline stabilization. The punchline to the story is that static contractions that\nstabilize the midsection are the most important and functional (powerful) muscu-\nlar contractions in that region. Static contractions for midline stabilization are the\nbest ab exercises known. No amount of crunches are ever going to get you to the\nsame end point as the L-sit, overhead squat, deadlift, etc.\nWhat we suspect is that if you could sequentially fire the abs with the same force\nin any kind of dynamic pattern, you would have the ability to seriously injure your\nspine. If you could ever crunch with the same force that you can stabilize, you\nwould be able to break your back at will. We have come hardwired unable to do\nthat\u2014that is my guess.\nThe movements are presented in the order in which they should be developed in\na client. The first thing is a simple hip extension: articulate at the hip only, maintain-\ning the distance from xiphoid process to pubic bone. There is no shortening of the\ntrunk. There is no trunk flexion,\njust hip extension and flexion\nwhile maintaining midline sta-\nbilization. The erectors are be-\ning used statically, and the"}

Then the back extends sequentially along the spine from \u201csouth\nto north\u201d (Figure 5).\nThis movement does a lot for a coach. It heightens a neurological awareness. It\nallows me to introduce some essential vernacular to the client. If we do not have\ncues that allow me to talk about hip flexion, trunk flexion, hip extension, trunk ex-\ntension, I am fairly worthless with a client. Very early, get clients to know terms. Be\nable to call it out and get the response you need.\nThis movement demonstrates tremendous control. There is hip flexion, hip ex-\ntension, trunk flexion and trunk extension in a combo \u201csnake\u201d move. Using those\nmuscles is essential for midline stabilization and working the posterior.\nThe fourth movement on the GHD is a sit-up but involves no trunk flexion. For the\nGHD sit-up, the pad is set so that the pelvis is free, and the athlete descends back\nto touch the ground and then comes back to seated. More than a few exercise\nphysiologists and certified trainers have observed that this movement is pure hip\nflexion and consequently asserted \u201cthere\u2019s no abs in that.\u201d\nBut what the abs are doing in this exercise is midline stabilization.\nBefore having clients perform the GHD sit-up, ensure they have demonstrated ca-\npacity in the hip extension, back extension, and hip-and-back extension. Even still,\ntheir first GHD sit-ups should be performed in a shortened range of motion, with\nthe trainer spotting behind them (Figure 6). That might be it for the first dose. Once\nthey come back and you can determine the effect from that dose, increase the\nrange of motion and volume as their capacity allows.\nTo perform a GHD sit-up, there is some leg flexion in the descent. Then, the leg\nextends dramatically and pulls the athlete to seated (Figure 7). Conversely, if the\nathlete does not extend the leg to come to seated, the primary movers are the hip"}
{"142": "The force with which an athlete comes up is amazing. Rather than being pulled\nfrom the psoas alone, which is a fairly dysfunctional kind of pull, the athlete uses\nthe full complement of hip-flexor musculature. Any time you are using a fraction of\nthe primary movers responsible for that articulation, it is not natural, not function-\nal, and contrary to nature. Not extending the leg can also be a little irritating to the\nlow back due to this shearing force on the lumbar spine. Performed correctly, the\nmovement is not irritating to the low back. Straightening that leg enables profound\nmusculature to lift from the pelvis.\nThere are people who have this irritation in the spine from a shear force. If you can\nteach them to extend the legs to work the full complement of hip flexors, we will\nmove the margins where this irritation occurs from 3 reps to 4 reps to 10 reps and\nso on. That is rehabilitation. That is neuromuscular re-education.\nThere is an adjunct movement to GHD sit-up in which the athlete is dynamic in the\ntrunk and static in the hip. It is the AbMat sit-up, where we deliberately take the\nhip flexors out of the equation and work the torso dynamically. The hip flexors are\nworking statically or possibly to no significant degree.\nTo do this, the hip flexors need to be removed from the line of action. The fat part\nof the AbMat goes toward the glutes, and the athlete puts the bottom of his or her\nsoles together with the knees butterflied. This positioning makes the hip flexors\ntangential to the line of action; i.e., they cannot do any productive work. This is\ndone deliberately. Then the athlete slowly and under control comes to seated by\ncontracting the abdominals. This is a very dynamic bit of trunk flexion and the hip\nflexors are removed (Figure 8).\nAs the athlete fails, adduct and extend the legs to some degree. This creates more\npurchase for the hip flexors and brings them into the line of action. This allows the\nathlete to modulate the assistance and keep each rep focused on the midsection.\nIf reps are performed slowly and deliberately, most athletes will fail a sit-up with-\nout an AbMat. The failure is not necessarily a neuromuscular failure. It is not"}

But that lum-\nbar region is fairly inflexible, and all that range of motion that is available moves\none from spinally extended through to neutral. There is no more shortening or\nflexion to it; it is not enough to sit up.\nWithout the AbMat, the sit-up is a biphasic movement. While I have solid contact,\nI use upper rectus and create enough momentum to throw the load to the hip\nflexors, where I have more connection. This means that the full rectus has little\nstimulus\u2014it is pulling me from spinally extended through to neutral, but absent\nof any load. The upper rectus is worked where there is a fulcrum, so the back flat-\ntens, but it is the hip flexors that pull me to seated. There is no amount of sit-ups\nyou can do on the ground that is ever going to work you from pubic bone to about\n3 or 4 inches above the belly button. The AbMat moves the athlete from spinally\nextended through to neutral in the lumbar spine against a load.\nHow big would your bench press get if you only pushed air? You would get as\nstrong as your abs will with a ground-based sit-up. With or without the pad, there\nis the same contraction and range of motion in the midsection. Without the pad,\nthe fibers shortened but there was no load and no real work completed. With the\npad, they got the same motion but under a load, and it produced fruitful work.\nThe two sit-ups, GHD and AbMat, complement each other beautifully. One is dy-\nnamic in the hips and static in the trunk; the other is dynamic in the trunk and stat-\nic in the hip. In conjunction with the L-sit (static in the trunk and hip), they develop\na formidable capacity in the midline."}

This requires continual study, and one\u2019s teaching will\nimprove with greater understanding in all fields that intersect with fitness.\nAn effective teacher also has a unique ability to relate to every student, regardless\nof his or her background and ability.

An effective teacher also takes\nownership for recognizing when communication between the teacher and athlete\nbreaks down.

A trainer needs multiple strategies for each fault because\ndifferent clients often respond to the same cue in a different manner.\nWhen multiple faults occur at once, a trainer is best served by attacking them one\nat a time in order of importance (i.e., triaging). The ordering is based on the se-\nverity of the deviation from ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task; no\nsingle ordering of faults can be used across all athletes and movements.

{"148": "HOW TO DEVELOP AS A TRAINER\nTo keep up with athletes\u2019 progress, a coach must continue to refine and develop\nhis or her knowledge. If a trainer\u2019s clients are not testing the limits of his or her\nknowledge, the trainer is not doing a good enough job with them. An expert coach\nis eager and proud to have a student exceed his or her abilities but seeks to delay\nit by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the athlete\u2019s\ngrowth. Coaches should focus on development in both academic and practical\nenvironments.\nHere are some suggestions for how trainers can develop:\n1) First and foremost, teach to learn. It is only through experience that\na trainer will learn and gain competency. It is imperative to work with\npeople in a dynamic environment, even if they are friends or family\nin the beginning. Understanding biochemistry, anatomy and teaching\nmethodologies is important and supportive of this endeavor, but it is not\nenough to allow a trainer to apply knowledge in real time.\n2) Watch more experienced coaches\u2014regardless of their specific discipline.\nWatch what they watch and when they watch for it. Listen to their cues.\nThe best coaches often need very few words to produce noticeable\nimprovement in mechanics. Also watch their rapport with clients. What\ndraws clients to them?\n3) Film yourself coaching others. This can also help with your ability to see\nand correct movement faults as you have the luxury of slowing down the\nfootage. Be critical of yourself and use the six criteria detailed above to\nassess strengths and areas for improvement.\n4) Attend a Level 2 Certificate Course (L2). The L2 allows trainers to work\non their coaching (specifically seeing and correcting movement) in the\npresence of their peers. Where the Level 1 Course is important for\nunderstanding the conceptual framework of CrossFit, the goal of the"}

The archives (since 2001) contain years\nof original CrossFit programming. It is a great resource for learning\nand experimenting with workouts. We challenge all trainers to follow\nCrossFit.com programming for at least six months to understand well-\nvaried and challenging CrossFit programming.

The demands of teaching and class management often take the\nattention away from seeing and correcting movement. New trainers are encour-\naged to coach friends and family in individual or small group sessions (two or\nthree athletes) to perfect their ability to improve mechanics before taking on large\ngroup classes.

Rhabdo-\nmyolysis (often simply referred to as \u201crhabdo\u201d) is a medical condition that might\narise from breakdown of muscle tissue and release of the muscle cells\u2019 contents\ninto the bloodstream. This process can damage the kidneys and can lead to renal\nfailure or death in rare cases. Rhabdo is diagnosed when a patient with an appro-\npriate history has an elevated level of creatine kinase, also known as CK or CPK.\nCPK is easier to measure in the blood than myoglobin and is generally used as a\nmarker for rhabdo, even though it is the myoglobin that does the damage.\nTreatment consists of generous amounts of intravenous (IV) fluids to dilute and\nflush the myoglobin through the kidneys. In the worst cases, patients might need\ndialysis while the kidneys recover. Death, though rare, can result when kidney fail-\nure causes imbalances in the usual electrolytes, which can cause cardiac arrhyth-\nmias. Most patients make a complete recovery after being rehydrated with IV fluids\nover anywhere from several hours to a week or so, depending on the severity.\nThere are a few ways a CrossFit trainer can protect athletes from rhabdomyolysis:\n\u2022 Follow the charter of mechanics, consistency, intensity.\n\u2022 Know the movements that have a higher rate of rhabdomyolysis incidence\n(those that prolong the eccentric contraction), and be mindful of the total"}

If there are no\nseparate classes for beginners, treat the workouts as technique sessions for new-\ner athletes\u2013focus on their mechanics rather than speed or load. There is no set\nprotocol for how quickly to increase intensity, but it is wise to err on the side of\ncaution and work toward long-term fitness. Multiple months at scaled loads and\nvolumes are well within a normal timeframe for even the best athletes, with gradu-\nal increases in intensity implemented after that. Trainers need to frequently check\nin with athletes to determine how the previous dose of exercise affected them.\nAlthough intensity is a significant part of CrossFit, each athlete has his or her entire\nlife to continue to improve fitness and tolerance for intensity.\nThe second way to mitigate the risk of rhabdomyolysis is to know the movements\nassociated with a higher rate of incidence. Beginner athletes should keep \u201cnega-\ntives\u201d (movements which prolong the eccentric phase) to a minimum. Although\nnegatives can be an effective way to increase strength, they should not be used\nin high volumes with beginners. Athletes may increase the volume of negatives\ngradually over time.\nWhile the eccentric phase of movements cannot and should not be avoided, there\nare movements in which people are more likely to prolong the eccentric phase. In\nCrossFit, these tend to be jumping pull-ups and full-range-of-motion glute-ham de-\nveloper (GHD) sit-ups. In the jumping pull-up, the athlete should not prolong the\ndescent but should instead immediately drop to an extended-arm position once\nthe chin has cleared the bar, absorbing the impact with the legs. Similarly, in the\nfull-range-of-motion GHD sit-up, newer athletes should use fewer repetitions and\npotentially a shortened range of motion until capacity is developed. It is also prudent\nfor trainers to scale the number of repetitions and the range of motion for athletes\nwho do not routinely use GHD sit-ups regardless of their CrossFit experience.

The discoloration of the urine comes from the muscle\u2019s myoglobin, which is\nthe same molecule that gives red meat its color. If these symptoms appear follow-\ning a workout (or at any time with regard to dark-red urine), the athlete should seek\nmedical attention immediately.\nThe athletes at highest risk seem to be those with a reasonable baseline level of\nfitness obtained through some non-CrossFit training, those who are returning to\nCrossFit after a layoff, or even experienced CrossFit athletes who reach volume\nor intensity significantly outside their established \u201cnorm.\u201d These athletes have\nsufficient muscle mass and conditioning to create enough intensity to hurt them-\nselves.

Each athlete needs enough space to perform the movements, with an\nadditional buffer to account for the errant-moving equipment, missed attempts,\nand safe passage of coaches or other athletes. Under no circumstances should a\ntrainer permit extra equipment like bars, plates, boxes, etc. to be left lying around\nthe workout area. This equipment might trip athletes or cause a ricochet if other\nequipment lands on it.\nIt is also imperative for a trainer to prepare for falls during dynamic movements. It is\npossible that an athlete might lose his or her grip during a kip (pull-up or muscle-up).\nTrainers might encourage athletes to wrap their thumbs around any bar in an ef-\nfort to provide additional feedback to the athlete. This is not foolproof, however,\nand can sometimes be even less secure, particularly for athletes with small hands.\nWhatever the hand position chosen, it does not replace the need for the athlete to\ndevelop body awareness of when to end the movement if his or her grip is compro-\nmised (wrapping thumbs is always recommended for barbell and ring movements\nto help provide better balance and control, especially in higher-risk scenarios such\nas a bench press or muscle-up). Boxes and racks should not be beneath, behind or\ndirectly in front of these athletes. Adjustable rings should be lowered to the appro-\npriate height. Where assistance boxes are necessary, they are best placed to the side\nof the working athlete (and not in another athlete\u2019s way) to leave a clear path should\nan athlete leave the apparatus prematurely. A suggestion for trainers trying to man-\nage these risks is to do a \u201cdry run\u201d of the workout before it begins: check the working\nspace for each athlete for each of the proposed movements. This can be as simple as\norganizing the class to rotate stations on the trainer\u2019s call and perform a quick walk-\nthrough to check spacing and arrangement.

As CrossFit workouts use relatively high intensity, ath-\nletes are working at their physical and psychological tolerances. It is possible for\nathletes to push too hard, and confounding environmental factors might exacer-\nbate certain situations.\nExtreme temperature fluctuations, especially heat, can be problematic. Trainers\nshould be ready in unseasonably hot and humid weather with sufficient water, and\nthey should watch for common signs of overexertion (e.g., dizziness). Hot weather\nalso increases the potential risk for rhabdomyolysis (although some cases have\noccurred in cold climates), and trainers should encourage athletes to stay hydrated\n(with the caveat that they should not be excessively hydrated. Current mainstream\nliterature suggests rates of 1.2 L/hour, which are actually too high and can lead to\noverhydration). In the event of a potential heat stroke following a workout (e.g.,\nathlete demonstrates an altered mental state), a trainer should remove excess\nclothing from the athlete and then douse him or her with cool water before med-\nical attention arrives.\nWeather aside, other conditions might need medical attention. Symptoms such\nas numbness or chronic pain in joints and muscles should be referred to medical\nprofessionals. Medical attention is immediately necessary for any non-respon-\nsive athlete."}

It also presents a serious risk of ex-\nercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), a potentially deadly dilution of the body\u2019s\nserum sodium concentration.

The\nmaster trainer is eager and proud to have a student exceed his abilities but seeks\nto delay it by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the\nathlete\u2019s growth.\nBecause I want my clients\u2019 training experience to transcend the physical realm,\nI am obligated to understand their jobs, hobbies, families, and goals. Motivating\nclients to transcend fitness requires that I be involved in their lives. This is not go-\ning to happen without my being both interested in them and interesting to them.\nBeing a voracious reader of books, newspapers, and magazines, I have no short-\nage of conversation, ideas, and knowledge to share, and so you will find me at my\nclients\u2019 parties, weddings, and family gatherings. Indeed, I am a personal friend to\nnearly every one of my clients. This is extremely gratifying work and often emo-\ntionally charged, but that is all right because I am an integral part of my athletes\u2019\nlives, and life is full of laughter, tears, and hope.\nOur friendship, the fun we have, and the frequency of our contact, coupled with\nthe scope of fitness\u2019s impact and the technical merits of my training, contribute to"}

More than just the\nbackbone of CrossFit\u2019s strength and successes, it has been, we believe, the prima-\nry reason for our success.\nUsing this template, we built a practice that kept us both busy from roughly\n5 to 10 a.m. Monday through Saturday. That schedule produced a low-six-figure in-\ncome, which is really amazing given that we got to work together, with our friends,\nhaving a positive impact on people\u2019s lives, and keep afternoons free for family,\nrecreation, and study.\nTraining with the attention and commitment that we bring to our practice, though\nfun and immensely rewarding, is also draining, and five appointments per day is\nabout all we could handle without an unacceptable drop in energy, focus, and,\nconsequently, professional standards.\nEventually, the demand for our training exceeded the time we were professionally\nable or willing to allot. In an effort to accommodate more athletes, we began to\nhold group classes.\nWe had used group classes to train some of our athletic teams, and everyone\nloved them, trainers and athletes alike. The social dynamic of group classes is ex-\ntremely powerful. Run correctly, they motivate an athletic output that is only rarely\nmatched in one-on-one training. The competition and camaraderie of the group\nclasses motivated our line \u201cmen will die for points\u201d and the recognition that Cross-\nFit is \u201cthe sport of fitness.\u201d\nGroup classes also dramatically increase training revenues!"}

The trainers who are running group\nclasses without growing into them are typically not working to the professional\ntraining standards that we have described. They also seem to have an inordinate\ndifficulty filling their classes.\nThis is exactly how we built our group classes. After working for years at the limit\nof our one-on-one capacity, we started accepting new clients by doubling them up\nwith other one-on-one clients to form one-on-two appointments.\nWe introduced the shift to group classes by telling the existing one-on-one clients\nthat we had good news for them: \u201cYour training rate is going to go down and we\u2019re\ngoing to introduce you to a new friend.\u201d Where there was resistance to sharing the\ntime we asked for a trial period.

Attention, en-\nthusiasm, voice projection, and engagement all have to escalate. It is an acquired\nskill\u2013an art, really. Our goal is to give so much attention and \u201cin your face\u201d presence\nto each participant that each is actually grateful that he did not get more attention.\nThe essential shift is that the level of scrutiny and criticism is ratcheted up along\nwith the rate of praise and input for each client.

The efficiency\nand effectiveness of this paradigm is breathtaking.\nWe have used the pursuit of excellence to guide our every move. For instance,\nwhen we were considering the last expansion of CrossFit Santa Cruz we could not\ndetermine whether it would be financially feasible or not. The variables were too\nnumerous and the assumptions too uncertain to convince any accountant of the\nwisdom of expansion, but when we asked the simple question, \u201cWill it improve\nthe quality of the programming and the training experience?\u201d the answer was a\nresounding \u201cYes!\u201d On expansion, the CrossFit Santa Cruz numbers tripled within\nsix months and the extra space allowed for some refinements and additions to our\nprogramming that would not have been possible otherwise.\nAs our seminars, journal, website, and affiliate program grew, we handed off the\ngroup classes to a new generation of CrossFit trainers who now cover most of the\noverhead costs of CrossFit Santa Cruz.

{"4": "UNDERSTANDING CROSSFIT\nOriginally published in April 2007.\nThe aims, prescription, methodology, implementation, and adaptations of Cross-\nFit are collectively and individually unique, defining of CrossFit, and instrumental\nin our program\u2019s successes in diverse applications.\nAIMS\nFrom the beginning, the aim of CrossFit has been to forge a broad, general, and in-\nclusive fitness. We sought to build a program that would best prepare trainees for\nany physical contingency\u2014prepare them not only for the unknown but for the un-\nknowable. Looking at all sport and physical tasks collectively, we asked what physi-\ncal skills and adaptations would most universally lend themselves to performance\nadvantage. Capacity culled from the intersection of all sports demands would\nquite logically lend itself well to all sport. In sum, our specialty is not specializing.\nPRESCRIPTION\nCrossFit is: \u201cconstantly varied, high-intensity functional movement.\u201d This is our\nprescription. Functional movements are universal motor recruitment patterns;\nthey are performed in a wave of contraction from core to extremity; and they are\ncompound movements\u2014i.e., they are multi-joint. They are natural, effective, and\nefficient locomotors of body and external objects. But no aspect of functional\nmovements is more important than their capacity to move large loads over long\ndistances, and to do so quickly. Collectively, these three attributes (load, distance,\nand speed) uniquely qualify functional movements for the production of high pow-\ner. Intensity is defined exactly as power, and intensity is the independent variable\nmost commonly associated with maximizing the rate of return of favorable adap-\ntation to exercise. Recognizing that the breadth and depth of a program\u2019s stimulus\nwill determine the breadth and depth of the adaptation it elicits, our prescription\nof functionality and intensity is constantly varied. We believe that preparation for\nrandom physical challenges\u2014i.e., unknown and unknowable events\u2014is at odds\nwith fixed, predictable, and routine regimens."}
{"5": "METHODOLOGY\nThe methodology that drives CrossFit is entirely empirical. We believe that mean-\ningful statements about safety, efficacy, and efficiency, the three most important\nand interdependent facets to evaluate any fitness program, can be supported only\nby measurable, observable, repeatable data. We call this approach \u201cevidence-based\nfitness.\u201d CrossFit\u2019s methodology depends on full disclosure of methods, results,\nand criticisms, and we have employed the internet to support these values. Our\ncharter is open source, making co-developers out of participating coaches, ath-\nletes, and trainers through a spontaneous and collaborative online community.\nCrossFit is empirically driven, clinically tested, and community developed.\nIMPLEMENTATION We\u2019ve take\nIn implementation, CrossFit is, quite simply, a sport\u2014the Sport of Fitness.

{"8": "Aside from the breadth or totality of fitness CrossFit seeks, our program is dis-\ntinctive, if not unique, in its focus on maximizing neuroendocrine response, de-\nveloping power, cross-training with multiple training modalities, constant training\nand practice with functional movements, and the development of successful\ndiet strategies.\nOur athletes are trained to bike, run, swim, and row at short, middle, and long\ndistances, guaranteeing exposure and competency in each of the three main met-\nabolic pathways.\nWe train our athletes in gymnastics from rudimentary to advanced movements,\ngarnering great capacity at controlling the body both dynamically and statically\nwhile maximizing strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility. We also place a heavy\nemphasis on Olympic weightlifting, having seen this sport\u2019s unique ability to devel-\nop an athlete\u2019s explosive power, control of external objects, and mastery of critical\nmotor recruitment patterns. And finally we encourage and assist our athletes to\nexplore a variety of sports as a vehicle to express and apply their fitness.\nAN EFFECTIVE APPROACH\nIn gyms and health clubs throughout the world the typical workout consists of\nisolation movements and extended aerobic sessions. The fitness community from\ntrainers to the magazines has the exercising public believing that lateral raises,\ncurls, leg extensions, sit-ups and the like combined with 20- to 40-minute stints on\nthe stationary bike or treadmill are going to lead to some kind of great fitness. Well,\nat CrossFit we work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high-in-\ntensity cardiovascular sessions. We have replaced the lateral raise with the push\npress, the curl with the pull-up, and the leg extension with the squat. For every\nlong-distance effort our athletes will do five or six at short distance. Why? Because\nfunctional movements and high intensity are radically more effective at eliciting\nnearly any desired fitness result. Startlingly, this is not a matter of opinion but\nsolid, irrefutable scientific fact, and yet the marginally effective old ways persist\nand are nearly universal. Our approach is consistent with what is practiced in elite"}
{"9": "training programs associated with major university athletic teams and profession-\nal sports. CrossFit endeavors to bring state-of-the-art coaching techniques to the\ngeneral public and athlete.\nIS THIS FOR ME?\nAbsolutely! Your needs and the Olympic athlete\u2019s differ by degree not kind. In-\ncreased power, speed, strength, cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, flexibility,\nstamina, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy are each important to the\nworld\u2019s best athletes and to our grandparents. The amazing truth is that the very\nsame methods that elicit optimal response in the Olympic or professional athlete\nwill optimize the same response in the elderly. Of course, we cannot load your\ngrandmother with the same squatting weight that we would assign an Olympic\nskier, but they both need to squat. In fact, squatting is essential to maintaining\nfunctional independence and improving fitness. Squatting is just one example\nof a movement that is universally valuable and essential yet rarely taught to any\nbut the most advanced of athletes. This is a tragedy. Through painstakingly thor-\nough coaching and incremental load assignment, CrossFit has been able to teach\neveryone who can care for himself or herself to perform safe-\nly and with maximum efficacy the same movements typically\nutilized by professional coaches in elite and certainly exclusive\nenvironments.\nWHO HAS BENEFITED FROM CROSSFIT?\nMany professional and elite athletes are participating in CrossFit.\nPrizefighters, cyclists, surfers, skiers, tennis players, triathletes\nand others competing at the highest levels are using CrossFit to\nadvance their core strength and conditioning, but that is not all.\nCrossFit has tested its methods on the sedentary, overweight,\npathological, and elderly and found that these special popula-\ntions met the same success as our stable of athletes. We call this\n\u201cbracketing.\u201d If our program works for Olympic skiers and over-\nweight, sedentary homemakers then it will work for you."}
{"10": "JUST WHAT IS A \u201cCORE STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING\u201d PROGRAM?\nCrossFit is a core strength and conditioning program in two distinct senses. First,\nwe are a core strength and conditioning program in the sense that the fitness\nwe develop is foundational to all other athletic\nneeds. This is the same sense in which the uni-\nversity courses required of a particular major\nare called the \u201ccore curriculum.\u201d This is the stuff\nthat everyone needs. Second, we are a \u201ccore\u201d\nstrength and conditioning program in the literal\nsense meaning the center of something. Much\nof our work focuses on the major functional axis\nof the human body, the extension and flexion\nof the hips and torso or trunk. The primacy of\ncore strength and conditioning in this sense is\nsupported by the simple observation that pow-\nerful hip extension alone is necessary and near-\nly sufficient for elite athletic performance. That\nis, our experience has been that no one without\nthe capacity for powerful hip extension enjoys\ngreat athletic prowess and nearly everyone we\nhave met with that capacity was a great athlete.\nRunning, jumping, punching, and throwing all\noriginate at the core. At CrossFit we endeavor\nto develop our athletes from the inside out, from core to extremity, which is, by\nthe way, how good functional movements recruit muscle, from the core to the\nextremities.\nCAN I ENJOY OPTIMAL HEALTH WITHOUT BEING AN ATHLETE?\nNo! Athletes experience a protection from the ravages of aging and disease that\nnon-athletes never find. For instance, 80-year-old athletes are stronger than\nnon-athletes in their prime at 25 years old. If you think that strength is not import-\nant, consider that strength loss is what puts people in nursing homes. Athletes\nhave greater bone density, stronger immune systems, less coronary heart dis-"}
{"11": "WHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO BE AN ATHLETE; I JUST WANT TO BE HEALTHY?\nYou are in luck. We hear this often, but the truth is that fitness, wellness, and pa-\nthology (sickness) are measures of the same entity: your health. There are a mul-\ntitude of measurable parameters that can be ordered from sick (pathological) to\nwell (normal) to fit (better than normal). These include but are not limited to blood\npressure, cholesterol, heart rate, body fat, muscle mass, flexibility, and strength.\nIt seems as though all of the body functions that can go awry have states that are\npathological, normal, and exceptional and that elite athletes typically show these\nparameters in the exceptional range. CrossFit\u2019s view is that fitness and health are\nthe same thing (see \u201cWhat Is Fitness? (Part 1)\u201d article). It is also interesting to notice\nthat the health professional maintains your health with drugs and surgery, each\nwith potentially undesirable side effects, whereas the CrossFit trainer typically\nachieves a superior result always with \u201cside benefit\u201d versus side effect.\nEXAMPLES OF CROSSFIT EXERCISES\nBiking, running, swimming, and rowing in an endless variety of drills. The clean and\njerk, snatch, squat, deadlift, push press, bench press, and power clean. Jumping,\nmedicine-ball throws and catches, pull-ups, dips, push-ups, handstands, presses\nto handstands, pirouettes, kips, cartwheels, muscle-ups, sit-ups, scales, and holds.\nWe make regular use of bikes, the track, rowing shells and ergometers, Olympic\nweight sets, rings, parallel bars, free exercise mats, horizontal bars, plyometrics\nboxes, medicine balls, and jump ropes.\nThere is not a strength and conditioning program anywhere that works with a\ngreater diversity of tools, modalities, and drills.\nWHAT IF I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF THIS?\nIt is a common sentiment to feel that because of the obligations of career and fami-\nly that you do not have the time to become as fit as you might like. Here is the good\nnews: World-class age group strength and conditioning is obtainable through an\nhour a day six days per week of training. It turns out that the intensity of training\nthat optimizes physical conditioning is not sustainable past 45 minutes to an hour.\nAthletes who train for hours a day are developing skill or training for sports that in-"}
{"12": "physical skills (cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, flexibility, strength,\npower, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy). The excessive aero-\nbic volume of the endurance athletes\u2019 training costs them in speed, power, and\nstrength to the point that their athletic competency has been compromised. No\ntriathlete is in ideal shape to wrestle, box, pole-vault, sprint, play any ball sport,\nfight fires, or do police work. Each of these requires a fitness level far beyond the\nneeds of the endurance athlete. None of this suggests that being a marathoner,\ntriathlete or other endurance athlete is a bad thing; just do not believe that training\nas a long-distance athlete gives you the fitness that is prerequisite to many sports.\nCrossFit considers the sumo wrestler, triathlete, marathoner, and powerlifter to\nbe \u201cfringe athletes\u201d in that their fitness demands are so specialized as to be incon-\nsistent with the adaptations that give maximum competency at all physical chal-\nlenges. Elite strength and conditioning is a compromise between each of the 10\nphysical adaptations. Endurance athletes do not balance that compromise.\nAEROBICS AND ANAEROBICS\nThere are three main energy systems that fuel all human activity. Almost all chang-\nes that occur in the body due to exercise are related to the demands placed on\nthese energy systems. Furthermore, the efficacy of any given fitness regimen may\nlargely be tied to its ability to elicit an adequate stimulus for change within these\nthree energy systems.\nEnergy is derived aerobically when oxygen is utilized to metabolize substrates de-\nrived from food and liberates energy. An activity is termed aerobic when the ma-\njority of energy needed is derived aerobically. These activities are usually greater\nthan 90 seconds in duration and involve low to moderate power output or inten-\nsity. Examples of aerobic activity include running on the treadmill for 20 minutes,\nswimming a mile, and watching TV.\nEnergy is derived anaerobically when energy is liberated from substrates in the\nabsence of oxygen. Activities are considered anaerobic when the majority of the\nenergy needed is derived anaerobically. In fact, properly structured, anaerobic ac-\ntivity can be used to develop a very high level of aerobic fitness without the muscle"}
{"13": "It warrants mention that in any activity all three energy systems are utilized\nthough one may dominate. The interplay of these systems can be complex, yet a\nsimple examination of the characteristics of aerobic versus anaerobic training can\nprove useful.\nCrossFit\u2019s approach is to judiciously balance anaerobic and aerobic exercise in a\nmanner that is consistent with the athlete\u2019s goals. Our exercise prescriptions ad-\nhere to proper specificity, progression, variation, and recovery to optimize\nadaptations.\nTHE OLYMPIC LIFTS, A.K.A., WEIGHTLIFTING\nThere are two Olympic lifts, the clean and jerk and\nthe snatch. Mastery of these lifts develops the\nsquat, deadlift, power clean, and split jerk while\nintegrating them into a single movement of un-\nequaled value in all of strength and conditioning.\nThe Olympic lifters are without a doubt the world\u2019s\nstrongest athletes.\nThese lifts train athletes to effectively activate more\nmuscle fibers more rapidly than through any other\nmodality of training. The explosiveness that results\nfrom this training is of vital necessity to every sport.\nPracticing the Olympic lifts teaches one to apply\nforce to muscle groups in proper sequence; i.e.,\nfrom the center of the body to its extremities (core\nto extremity). Learning this vital technical lesson benefits all athletes who need\nto impart force to another person or object, as is commonly required in near-\nly all sports.\nIn addition to learning to impart explosive forces, the clean and jerk and snatch\ncondition the body to receive such forces from another moving body both safely"}
{"14": "GYMNASTICS\nThe extraordinary value of gymnastics as a training modality lies in its reliance on\nthe body\u2019s own weight as the sole source of resistance. This places a unique premi-\num on the improvement of strength-to-weight ratio. Unlike other strength training\nmodalities, gymnastics and calisthenics allow for increases in strength only while\nincreasing strength-to-weight ratio!\nGymnastics develops pull-ups, squats, lunges, jumping, push-ups, and numerous\npresses to handstand, scales, and holds. These skills are unrivaled in their benefit\nto the physique, as evident in any competitive gymnast.\nAs important as the capacity of this modality is for strength development, it is with-\nout a doubt the ultimate approach to improving coordination, balance, agility, ac-\ncuracy, and flexibility. Through the use of numerous presses, handstands, scales,\nand other floor work, the gymnast\u2019s training greatly enhances kinesthetic sense.\nThe variety of movements available for inclusion in this modality probably exceeds\nthe number of exercises known to all non-gymnastic sport! The rich variety here\ncontributes substantially to CrossFit\u2019s ability to inspire great athletic confidence\nand prowess.\nFor a combination of strength, flexibility, well-developed physique, coordina-\ntion, balance, accuracy, and agility, the gymnast has no equal in the sports world.\nThe inclusion of this training modality is absurdly absent from nearly all train-\ning programs.\nROUTINES\nThere is no ideal routine! In fact, the chief value of any routine lies in abandon-\ning it for another. The CrossFit ideal is to train for any contingency. The obvious\nimplication is that this is possible only if there is a tremendously varied quality to\nthe breadth of stimulus. It is in this sense that CrossFit is a core strength and con-\nditioning program. Anything else is sport-specific training, not core strength and\nconditioning."}

Now we can tell you that one of the critical\nelements missing from these movements is that they invoke essentially no neuro-\nendocrine response.\nAmong the hormonal responses vital to athletic development are substantial\nincreases in testosterone, insulin-like growth factor, and human growth hor-\nmone.

{"18": "WHAT SHOULD I EAT?\nIn plain language, base your diet on garden vegetables (especially greens), meats,\nnuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar. That is about as simple as we\ncan get. Many have observed that keeping your grocery cart to the perimeter of the\ngrocery store while avoiding the aisles is a great way to protect your health.

The caveman model is perfect-\nly consistent with CrossFit\u2019s prescription.\nWHAT FOODS SHOULD I AVOID?\nExcessive consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates is the primary culprit in\nnutritionally caused health problems. High-glycemic carbohydrates are those that\nraise blood sugar too rapidly. They include rice, bread, candy, potato, sweets, so-\ndas, and most processed carbohydrates. Processing can include bleaching, bak-\ning, grinding, and refining. Processing of carbohydrates greatly increases their\nglycemic index, a measure of their propensity to elevate blood sugar.\nWHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH HIGH-GLYCEMIC CARBOHYDRATES?\nThe problem with high-glycemic carbohydrates is that in excess they give an inor-\ndinate insulin response.

Sport is the application of fitness in a fan-\ntastic atmosphere of competition and mastery.

It is, after all, the com-\nbined expression, or application, of the 10 general skills that is our motivation for\ntheir development in the first place. Sports and games like soccer, martial arts,\nbaseball, and basketball, in contrast to our training workouts, have more varied\nand less predictable movements. But, where sports develop and require all 10\ngeneral skills simultaneously, they do so slowly compared to our strength and con-\nditioning regimen. Sport is better, in our view, at expression and testing of skills\nthan it is at developing these same skills. Both expression and development are\ncrucial to our fitness.

They gave rea-\nsonable definitions to each of these 10 so that they seemed fairly distinct. Keep\nin mind, however, nature has no obligation to recognize these distinctions.

There is more opportunity of advancing athletic performance via\nadvancing GPP than there is in more sport-specific strength and conditioning\ntraining. For example, I am not sure why more pull-ups make for better skiers,\nbut they do. We have some theories why that occurs, but we do not actually need\nto know the mechanism. We are focused on advancing performance.\nSo the second model is a statistical model using skills and drills. I am looking for a\nbalance of capacity across training modalities.\nThe third model uses the three metabolic pathways. These are the three engines\nthat produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the currency of effort of all energy\noutput. Power is plotted on the Y-axis and duration of effort (time) on the X-axis.\nThe first pathway (phosphagen or phosphocreatine) is high powered and short\nduration. It can account for about 100 percent of max human output and taps out\nat about 10 seconds. The second pathway (lactate or glycolytic) is moderate pow-\nered, moderate duration. It accounts for approximately 70 percent of max pow-\ner output, peaks at about 60 seconds and terminates at 120 seconds. The third\npathway (oxidative or aerobic) is low powered, long duration. It accounts for ap-\nproximately 40 percent of max power output and does not fade in any reasonable\ntime for which I have the patience to measure. The phosphagen and the glycolytic\npathways are anaerobic; oxidative is aerobic. All three engines work all the time to\nsome extent. The degree to which each is active is dependent on the activity. One\nidles, while the other two rev; two will rev, one will idle, etc.\nOur thought is this: He or she is as fit as he or she is balanced in capacity in all\nthree of these engines. A human being is a vehicle with three engines. Suppose we\ndiscover there is a fourth engine; we want capacity there, too.

First, understand that our defini-\ntions of these quantities are measurable. One of the problems with exercise sci-\nence is that it would very rarely meet the rigors of any real science (chemistry,\nphysics, engineering).\nSecondly, it is also almost never about exercise. For example, maximal oxygen\nconsumption (VO2 max) and lactate threshold are correlates, maybe components,\nbut absolutely subordinate to what happens to work capacity. Who would take an\nincrease in VO2max for a decrease in work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains? What that would look like is breathing more air than you ever had before\non a treadmill test in a lab but losing the road race. Similarly, someone\u2019s lactate\nthreshold could increase, but he or she still gets choked out in the fight because of\nlack of work capacity.\nI could make a list of hundreds of these metrics, and no one has ever produced\na great athlete by advancing them one at a time. It does not happen. I can move\nthem best by doing constantly varied, high-intensity functional movements; doing\nthings that look like Fran, Diane, Helen; turning fitness into sport by working with\nfixed workloads and trying to minimize the time by making every workout a com-\npetitive effort among the cohort. And when I do that, what we find is that these\nmetrics do spectacular things.\nSuppose a man at 90 years old is living independently, running up and down the\nsteps and playing with his grandchildren. We would not be concerned if his choles-\nterol numbers were \u201chigh.\u201d There is a problem looking only at longevity. Imagine\na curve that stretches to 90 or even 105 years but has very low work capacity for\nits duration. That is not what CrossFit is about: It is about vitality and capacity.\nWhat can you do?\nIt is imperative for making meaningful assertions about training that fitness and\nhealth are measurable.

{"42": "TECHNIQUE\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s Dec. 1, 2007, L1 lecture in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nIn no small part, what is behind this program is the quantification of fitness. This\nmeans we put a number on fitness: work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains. You can assess one\u2019s fitness by determining the area under his or her\nwork-capacity curve. This would be similar to a group of athletes competing in 25\nto 30 workouts. Include a range of activities\u2014like three pulls on the Concept2 row-\ner for average watts to a 10-mile run\u2014and a multitude of workouts in between.\nCompile their overall placing across these events, and everyone then has a reason-\nable metric of his or her total capacity.\nThis quantification of fitness is a part of a broader concept that is at the heart of\nthis movement: We call it evidence-based fitness. This means measurable, observ-\nable, repeatable data is used in analyzing and assessing a fitness program. There\nare three meaningful components to analysis of a fitness program: safety, efficacy,\nand efficiency.\nThe efficacy of a program means, \u201cWhat is the return?\u201d Maybe a fitness program\nadvertises that it will make you a better soccer player. There needs to be evidence\nof this supported by measurable, observable, repeatable data. For CrossFit, we\nwant to increase your work capacity across broad time and modal domains. This is\nthe efficacy of this program. What are the tangible results? What is the adaptation\nthat the program induces?\nEfficiency is the time rate of that adaptation. Maybe the fitness program adver-\ntises that it can deliver 50 pull-ups. There is a big difference whether it takes six\nmonths versus nine years to achieve that.\nSafety is how many people end up at the finish line. Suppose I have a fitness pro-\ngram.

{"43": "For the qualification of movement there are four common terms: mechanics,\ntechnique, form and style. I will not delve into them with too much detail: The\ndistinction is not that important. I use both technique and form somewhat inter-\nchangeably, although there is a slightly nuanced distinction.\nWhen I talk about angular velocity, momentum, leverage, origin or insertion of\nmuscles, torque, force, power, relative angles, we are taking about mechanics.\nWhen I speak to the physics of movement, and especially the statics and less so\nthe dynamics, I am looking at the mechanics.\nTechnique is the method to success for completion of a movement. For example, if\nyou want to do a full twisting dismount on the rings, the technique would be: pull,\nlet go, look, arm up, turn, shoulder drop, etc. Technique includes head posture and\nbody posture. And there are effective and less effective techniques. Technique\nincludes the mechanics, but it is in the macro sense of \u201chow do you complete the\nmovement without the physics?\u201d\nForm is the normative value: This is good or this is bad\u2014\u201cyou should\u201d or \u201cyou\nshouldn\u2019t\u201d applied to mechanics and technique.\nStyle is essentially the signature to a movement; that is, that aspect of the move-\nment that is fairly unique to you.

It is the signature. To be truly just\nthe signature, style elements have no bearing on form, technique or mechanics.\nStyle does not enter into the normative assessment, is not important to technique,\nand does not alter substantially the physics.\nThese four terms are all qualifications to movement.

I want\nto look at typing, shooting, playing the violin, NASCAR driving and CrossFit. What\nthese domains have in common is that a marked proficiency is associated with\nspeed. Being able to shoot accurately and quickly is better than quickly or accurately.\nYou may try to get a job as a typist because you do not make any mistakes. How-\never, for this perfection, you type at a rate of 20 words a minute and only use two\nfingers. You will never get hired. Playing the violin fast and error-free is critical for\na virtuoso.

One is impossible without the other.\nTechnique and speed are not at odds with one another, where \u201cspeed\u201d is related\nto all the quantification of the movement: power, force, distance, time. They are\nseemingly at odds. It is a misapprehension. It is an illusion.\nCan you learn to drive fast without wrecking? Can you learn to type fast without\nmaking errors? Can you shoot quickly without missing? Eventually, but not in the\nlearning.

Work at that 10,000 to 12,000\nfoot-pounds per minute mark to fix the form, and soon enough you will have great\ntechnique at 12,000 foot-pounds per minute. The next step is to achieve that tech-\nnique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute.\nAt first, the technique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute will suffer. Then you must\nnarrow it in.

Some of the refined motor-recruitment\npatterns are not going to always look perfect.\nI do not know of a domain where speed matters and technique is not at the heart\nof it.

And one of the things that insulin puts into cells is fat.\nYou can see that the way to get your insulin level too high (hyperinsulinism) is to\neat too much carbohydrate. How much carbohydrate is that? In the qualitative\nsense, your insulin level is \u201ctoo high\u201d if it is driving up your blood pressure, mak-\ning you fat or reducing your ability to suppress blood sugar after eating carbo-\nhydrate.

{"67": "TYPICAL CROSSFIT BLOCK PRESCRIPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS\nTo best understand the Zone Diet, CrossFit athletes should read Dr. Barry Sears\u2019\nbook \u201cEnter the Zone.\u201d This article gives more information regarding block pre-\nscriptions and fat adjustments for CrossFit athletes.\nThe chart based on sex and body type in the article \u201cZone Meal Plans\u201d is perfect\nfor those who want to start the Zone Diet. If the athlete chooses the wrong block\nsize and does not obtain the desired results, the plan can be modified after a few\nweeks. Errors in block selection might slow progress, but initial errors are offset by\nthe huge value in starting a practice of weighing and measuring intake.\nSears details a more precise method to calculate one\u2019s block prescription in \u201cEnter\nthe Zone.\u201d It is:\nZone block prescription = lean body mass (lb.) x activity level (g/lb. of lean\nbody mass) / 7 (g protein/block)\nThe activity level ranges on a scale of 0-1. For those who work out several days a\nweek and do not have a labor-intensive job, the activity level should be 0.7 (most\nCrossFit athletes). By dividing 0.7 by 7 g in the equation, this simplifies to a Zone\nblock prescription that is 10 percent of his or her lean mass.\nThe activity factor should increase if the athlete does CrossFit two or more times a\nday, trains for another sport in addition to CrossFit, or holds a strenuous daily job\n(e.g., construction, farming, etc., and potentially coaching, if on one\u2019s feet all day).\nAlthough CrossFit workouts are relatively intense, they are not long in duration.\nAn individual does not need to increase the activity level value based on intensity\nalone; activity volume determines activity factor.\nSAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE ZONE BLOCK PRESCRIPTION\nSuppose an athlete is 185 lb. (84 kg) with 16 percent body fat. He does CrossFit five\ndays per week and works in a typical office environment. A sample calculation of"}
{"68": "TABLE 1. MACRONUTRIENT AND CALORIE COMPOSITION\nFOR 15 BLOCKS A DAY\nProtein 15 blocks x 7 g = 105 g (420 calories)\nCarbohydrate 15 blocks x 9 g = 135 g (540 calories)\nFat 15 blocks x 3 g = 45 g (405 calories)\nTotal Calories = 1,365\nNote the total calories presented here are underestimated due to hidden calories.\nMost foods are classified by a single macronutrient, despite the presence of some\nother macronutrients (e.g., nuts are classified as a fat but have some protein and\ncarbohydrate calories). These less predominant macronutrients for each source\nare not included in the total calorie calculations.\nThis athlete could also choose to round up to 16 blocks, particularly if he or she is\nmore likely to have compliance issues. The Zone prescription is a calorie-restrictive\ndiet and can be especially difficult for new adopters. When one\u2019s calculation has a\ndecimal value, rounding up to the next whole block might result in slower progress\nbut produce better long-term compliance. Once the athlete has become accus-\ntomed to the diet, then the total blocks can be rounded down to 15, particularly if\ndesired body composition has not been achieved.\nINCREASING FAT INTAKE\nThe caloric restriction leans out the athlete while providing enough protein and\ncarbohydrate for typical CrossFit activity levels. However, the athlete can become\ntoo lean. The athlete is considered \u201ctoo lean\u201d when performance decreases in\ncombination with continued weight loss. \u201cToo lean\u201d should not be based on body\nweight or appearance alone. When a loss of mass coincides with a drop in perfor-\nmance, the athlete needs to add calories to the diet. This can be accomplished by\ndoubling the fat intake (Table 2)."}
{"69": "At twice the fat, the macronutrient ratio based on calories has changed from 30\npercent protein, 40 percent carbohydrate, 30 percent fat to 23 percent protein,\n31 percent carbohydrate, 46 percent fat. Fat can continue to be multiplied if the\nathlete experiences further mass loss and performance decline. Some CrossFit\nathletes have a diet including five times the fat (Table 3).\nTABLE 3.

{"70": "SUPPLEMENTATION\nWhole, unprocessed foods are the best source of both macronutrients and micro-\nnutrients in terms of composition, variety, and density, such that supplementation\nis generally not recommended. We contend that eating a diet composed of known\nquantities and of high-quality whole foods is the most important aspect of nutri-\ntion for improved performance and health. Not only are supplements generally\npoorer nutrient sources, but they are also an unnecessary focus for someone not\nfollowing our basic diet plan of weighed and measured meat and vegetables, etc.\nHowever, we find one supplement beneficial enough to make a blanket recom-\nmendation: fish oil. Fish oil provides omega-3 fatty acids, which are a type of poly-\nunsaturated fat.\nPhysiological fats are known as triglycerides in biological terms; they are composed\nof a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached (Figure 1). The attached fatty\nacids are mixtures of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats. Al-\nthough one fatty acid is prominent in each food, all three are represented to some\ndegree. Figure 2 provides a summary of the types of fat and example food sources.\nThe two types of polyunsaturated fats found most frequently in foods are ome-\nga-3 and omega-6 fats. Classifying a fatty acid as omega-3 versus omega-6 is\ndependent on chemical structure. Polyunsaturated fats are sources of the two\nessential fatty acids, meaning they must be obtained from the diet. They are al-\npha-linolenic acid (ALA) (an omega-3) and linoleic acid (LA) (an omega-6). Ome-\nga-3 fats are known as \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d fats, and omega-6 fats are known as\n\u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d fats based on their physiological functions. Both are needed\nin relatively equal quantities."}
{"71": "Figure 2. Summary of Fatty Acids and Example Food Sources."}
{"72": "Fish-oil supplementation improves the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids\nand reduces the inflammatory responses in the body. Fish oil provides two types\nof omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid\n(DHA), the form of omega-3 fats preferred by the brain and body. The body can\nconvert ALA to EPA and DHA, but the conversion process is inefficient. Some prac-\ntitioners have recommended a combined daily intake on the order of 3 grams of\nEPA and DHA for an otherwise healthy individual, although the exact amount is\ndictated by one\u2019s total omega-6 intake. Each brand of fish oil has a different con-\ncentration of EPA and DHA per serving as indicated on the label. Individuals might\nhave to take multiple servings to get 3 grams of EPA and DHA, as brands might\ninclude omega-3s that are neither EPA nor DHA (e.g., ALA). Flax seed or oil is not an\nappropriate supplement for omega-3s. Flax is a good source of ALA, but because\nof the poor conversion to EPA and DHA, it is not recommended.

There are other factors that\nwill ultimately overshadow any disadvantages inherent in the potentially less ef-\nfective regimen, such as convenience, attitude, exercise selection, and pacing.\nFor the remainder of this article the three-day cycle is the one in discussion, but\nmost of the analysis and discussion applies perfectly to the five-day cycle.\nELEMENTS BY MODALITY\nLooking at the Template Macro View (Table 1) it can readily be seen that the tem-\nplate is based on the rotation of three distinct modalities: monostructural meta-\nbolic conditioning (M), gymnastics (G), and weightlifting (W). The monostructural\nmetabolic conditioning activities are commonly referred to as \u201ccardio,\u201d the pur-\npose of which is primarily to improve cardiorespiratory capacity and stamina.\nThey are repetitive, cyclical movements that could be sustained for long periods\nof time. The gymnastics modality comprises body-weight exercises/elements or\ncalisthenics, and its primary purpose is to improve body control by improving\nneurological components such as coordination, balance, agility, and accuracy, and\nto improve functional upper-body capacity and trunk strength. The weightlifting\nmodality comprises the most important weight-training basics, Olympic lifts and\npowerlifting, where the aim is primarily to increase strength, power, and hip/leg\ncapacity. This category includes any exercise with the addition of an external load.\nTable 2 gives the common exercises used by our program, separated by modality,\nin fleshing out the routines.\nFor metabolic conditioning the exercises are run, bike, row, and jump rope. The\ngymnastics modality includes air squats, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, handstand\npush-ups, rope climbs, muscle-ups, presses to handstands, back/hip extensions,\nsit-ups, and jumps (vertical, box, broad, etc.). The weightlifting modality includes\nTABLE 2. EXERCISES BY MODALITY"}
{"76": "deadlifts, cleans, presses, snatches, clean and jerks, medicine-ball drills and\nthrows, and kettlebell swings.\nThe elements, or exercises, chosen for each modality were selected for their\nfunctionality, neuroendocrine response, and overall capacity to dramatically and\nbroadly impact the human body.\nWORKOUT STRUCTURE\nThe workout structure varies by the inclusion of one, two, or three modalities for\neach day (Table 3). Days 1, 5, and 9 are each single-modality workouts whereas days\n2, 6, and 10 include two modalities each (couplets), and finally, days 3, 7, and 11 use\nthree modalities each (triplets). In every case each modality is represented by a\nsingle exercise or element; i.e., each M, W, and G represents a single exercise from\nmetabolic conditioning, weightlifting, and gymnastics modalities respectively.\nWhen the workout includes a single exercise (days 1, 5, and 9) the focus is on a\nsingle exercise or effort. When the element is the single \u201cM\u201d (day 1) the workout is\na single effort and is typically a long, slow, distance effort. When the modality is a\nsingle \u201cG\u201d (day 5) the workout is practice of a single skill, and typically this skill is\nsufficiently complex to require great practice but might not be yet suitable for in-\nclusion in a timed workout because performance is not yet adequate for efficient\ninclusion. When the modality is the single \u201cW\u201d (day 9) the workout is a single lift and\ntypically performed at high weight and low repetition. It is worth repeating that the\nfocus on days 1, 5, and 9 is single efforts of \u201ccardio\u201d at long distance; improving\nhigh-skill, more complex gymnastics movements; and single/low-rep heavy\nweightlifting basics, respectively. This is not the day to work sprints, pull-ups, or\nhigh-repetition clean and jerks \u2014the other days would be more appropriate.\nTABLE 3.

{"79": "SCALING CROSSFIT\nCrossFit workouts, and especially those on CrossFit.com, are designed to chal-\nlenge even the most advanced athlete. Many athletes need to \u201cscale\u201d (i.e., modify)\nthe workouts for the safest implementation of the program. Finding a CrossFit\naffiliate is one way to receive proper coaching and guidance through this pro-\ncess. In absence of an experienced trainer, this article presents some basic\nconcepts for scaling workouts particularly for beginners. Scaling for other pop-\nulations (e.g., advanced or injured athletes) is discussed in greater detail at the\nLevel 2 Certificate Course, as well as in the Online Scaling Course.\nAthletes will need to scale workouts for variable lengths of time. One\u2019s athletic\nbackground, as well as his or her current health and fitness capacity, dictates how\nlong scaling is necessary. The methodology presented here can be used indefi-\nnitely, but a month is the minimum period for which significant scaling should be\napplied. This introductory period serves two purposes: 1) it develops competency\nof movements used in CrossFit; and 2) it appropriately exposes the athlete to grad-\nual increases in intensity and volume.\nMECHANICS AND CONSISTENCY FIRST\nCrossFit\u2019s charter for creating the most optimal balance of safety, efficacy, and\nefficiency is: mechanics, consistency, then\u2014and only then\u2014intensity. The initial\nexposure to CrossFit is when movement mechanics should be prioritized over in-\ntensity. And for some, just practicing the movements will be intense. It is impera-\ntive that the movements can be performed correctly and consistently before load\nand speed are added. While intensity is an important part of the CrossFit program,\nit is added after movement proficiency is established. Ignoring this order increas-\nes the risk for injury and potentially blunts long-term progress, especially if poor\nmechanics are combined with load.\nSCALING EFFECTIVELY: PRESERVE THE STIMULUS\nWhen scaling workouts, the main principle to follow is \u201cpreserve the stimulus.\u201d"}
{"80": "Intensity and Volume\nTwo factors need to be scaled for every beginner: 1) intensity; and 2) volume. A\nprudent method for beginners is reducing intensity and/or volume by half for at\nleast two weeks. Depending on how the athlete progresses, volume and intensity\ncan be gradually increased in the following weeks, months, and years.\nIntensity refers to the amount of power an athlete generates. Intensity may be\nmodified in three ways: 1) load; 2) speed; and/or 3) volume.\nLoad is the variable to scale first; scaling the load is an easy way to preserve the\nstimulus relative to an athlete\u2019s capacity. Load is also the most common variable\nmodified after the beginner period. Especially for a conditioning workout, the ath-\nlete should use a load that ensures he or she is able to complete the first set or\nround without compromising form or reaching muscular failure. Determining ap-\npropriate loads for newer athletes requires some estimation, and scaling will not\nalways be perfect. Often, loads for newer athletes will be less than 50 percent\nof the prescribed load, especially if an athlete is new to lifting weights. Coaches\nshould err on the side of scaling too much rather than not enough, particularly for\nnewer athletes.\nSpeed tends to be more self-modulated due to the athlete\u2019s fitness level, although\na coach can modulate speed based on the mechanics demonstrated. A coach\nmight have to slow an athlete down to achieve the correct mechanics. Similarly,\ncoaches might have to encourage an athlete who is moving well to move faster,\nthough this is less common when working with beginners (see \u201cTechnique\u201d article).\nVolume is the total amount of work accomplished by the athlete. Depending on\nthe workout, volume can be lowered by reducing: 1) time; 2) reps/rounds; and/or\n3) distance.\nNewer CrossFit athletes might attempt to struggle through a workout where\nthe volume of repetitions (or load, above) is beyond their current capacity. For\nexample, an advanced CrossFit athlete might complete Fran in 2 minutes. That"}
{"81": "Movements\nWhen a movement cannot be performed at all, it can be substituted. CrossFit\nsuggests modifying this variable last because avoiding a movement prevents an\nindividual from developing proficiency in it. An athlete or trainer should first try re-\nducing the load before substituting the movement. If the workout calls for snatch-\nes at 95 lb., for example, it is generally preferable that the athlete performs the\nsnatches with a PVC pipe instead of substituting 95-lb. overhead squats.\nComplete movement substitutions should be considered when a physical limita-\ntion or injury is present, or when the load cannot be reduced. When selecting a\nsubstitute movement, trainers should try to preserve the original movement\u2019s\nfunction and range of motion as best they can. When determining movement sub-\nstitutions consider:\n1) Whether the movement is primarily driven by the lower body or\nupper body.\n2) The movement function (e.g., push versus pull).\n3) The range of motion used by the movement (specifically of the hips,\nknees, and ankles).\n4) The plane of movement.\nParticularly in the case of injury, a complete movement replacement might be nec-\nessary. Consideration of these variables can help trainers select a movement sub-\nstitution or replacement that is as similar as possible to the prescribed movement.\nA SAMPLE WEEK OF SCALING\nThis section outlines five typical CrossFit workouts. For each Workout of the Day\n(WOD), scaled workouts are presented with modifications to volume, load, and\nmovements. Some of the rationale for the options is also described. These scaled\nworkouts should be considered but three examples of the many options available.\nThey do not take the place of scaled workouts created by an experienced trainer\nwho is relying on intuition and detailed knowledge of a specific athlete."}

{"108": "THE AIR SQUAT\nAll our athletes begin their squatting with the \u201cair squat\u201d; that is, without any\nweight other than body weight. As a matter of terminology, when we refer to the\n\u201csquat\u201d we are talking about an unladen, body-weight-only squat. When we wish\nto refer to a weighted squat we will use the term back squat, overhead squat, or\nfront squat, referring to those distinct weighted squats. Training with the front,\nback, and overhead squats before the weightless variant has been mastered re-\ntards athletic potential and compromises safety and efficacy.\nWhen has the squat been mastered? This is a good question. It is fair to say that\nthe squat is mastered when both technique and performance are superior. This\nsuggests that none of the points of performance are deficient and fast multiple\nreps are possible. Our favorite standard for fast multiple reps would be the Ta-\nbata squat (20 seconds on/10 seconds off repeated 8 times) with the weakest of\neight intervals being between 18 and 20 reps. Do not misunderstand \u2014we are\nlooking for 18-20 perfect squats in 20 seconds, rest for 10, and repeat seven\nmore times for a total of eight intervals.\nThe most common faults to look for are surrendering of the lumbar curve at the\nbottom, not breaking the parallel plane with the hips, slouching in the chest and\nshoulders, lifting the heels, and not fully extending the hip at the top (Figure 1).\nDo not even think about weighted squats until none of these faults belong to you.\nA relatively small angle of hip extension, while indicative of a beginner\u2019s or weak\nsquat and caused by weak hips extensors, is not strictly considered a fault as\nlong as the lumbar spine is neutral.\nCAUSES OF A BAD SQUAT\n1) Weak glute/hamstring. The glutes and hams are responsible for powerful\nhip extension, which is the key to the athletic performance universe.\n2) Poor engagement, weak control, and no awareness of glute and\nhamstring. The road to powerful, effective hip extension is a three-to-\nfive-year odyssey for most athletes."}

Your max overhead squat is an excellent measure of your\ncore stability and control and ultimately your ability to generate effective and effi-\ncient athletic power.\nYour max overhead squat will always be a fraction of the average of your max\nback and front squat but, ideally, with time, they should converge rather than di-\nverge (Figure 8).\nShould they diverge, you are developing hip and core strength, but your capaci-\nty to efficiently apply power distally is reduced. In athletic pursuits you might be\nprone to injury. Should they converge, you are developing useful strength and\npower that can be successfully applied to athletic movements.\nThe functional application or utility of the overhead squat might not be readily\napparent, but there are many real-world occurrences where objects high enough\nto get under are too heavy or not free enough to be jerked or pressed overhead"}

{"121": "body from which these movements emanate, the core, is often referred to as the\n\u201cpower zone.\u201d The muscle groups comprising the \u201cpower zone\u201d include the hip flex-\nors, hip extensors (glutes and hams), spinal erectors, and quadriceps.\nThese lifts are enormous aids to developing the power zone. Additionally, the ad-\nvanced elements of the progression, the push press and jerk, train for and devel-\nop power and speed. Power and speed are \u201cking\u201d in sport performance. Coupling\nforce with velocity is the very essence of power and speed. Some of our favorite\nand most developmental lifts lack this quality.

{"124": "SUMMARY\nFrom shoulder press to push jerk the movements become increasingly more ath-\nletic, functional, and suited to heavier loads. The progression also increasingly\nrelies on the power zone. In the shoulder press, the power zone is used for stabi-\nlization only. In the push press the power zone provides not only stability but also\nthe primary impetus in both the dip and drive. In the push jerk the power zone is\ncalled on for the dip, drive, second dip, and squat. The role of the hip is increased\nin each exercise.\nWith the push press you will be able to drive overhead as much as 30 percent more\nweight than with the shoulder press. The push jerk will allow you to drive as much\nas 30 percent more overhead than you would with the push press.\nIn effect the hip is increasingly recruited through the progression of lifts to assist\nthe arms and shoulders in raising loads overhead. After mastering the push jerk\nyou will find that it will unconsciously displace the push press as your method of\nchoice when going overhead.\nThe second dip on the push jerk will become lower and lower as you both master\nthe technique and increase the load. At some point in your development, the loads\nwill become so substantial that the upper body cannot contribute but a fraction\nto the movement, at which point the catch becomes very low and an increasing\namount of the lift is accomplished by the overhead squat.\nOn both the push press and jerk, the \u201cdip\u201d is critical to the entire movement. The\nstomach is held very tightly and the resultant turnaround from dip to drive is sud-\nden, explosive, and violent.\nTRY THESE\n1) Start with 95 lb. and push press or push jerk 15 straight repetitions, rest\n30 seconds, and repeat for total of 5 sets of 15 repetitions each. Go up\nin weight only when you can complete all 5 sets with only 30 seconds of\nrest between each and do not pause in any set."}

{"133": "THE GLUTE-HAM DEVELOPER (GHD)\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s March 18, 2007, L1 lecture in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nOur definition of core strength is midline stabilization. In profile, there is a ref-\nerence line that trisects the spine and bisects the pelvis. Midline stabilization is\nthe ability to maintain rigidity, stability, and a lack of deflection about that line\n(Figure 1). This translates to improved efficiency and performance and greater\npower output.\nIt is critical to the deadlift, to the laden squat, to the shoulder press, and to any\nsport. In a swimmer\u2019s stroke\u2014when the left leg kicks and right arm pulls\u2014if the\ntorso deviates to one side, you lose energy. Energy is lost in its deflection, wheth-\ner throwing a punch, riding a bicycle, or squatting. The abdominals, with the hip\nflexors, control one side of the torso, with the hip extensors and erectors involved\non the other side.\nHowever, what we have in modern physical culture is an excessive awareness\nand focus on the anterior and not on the posterior. As a culture of athletes and\nnon-athletes alike, we are unfortunately frontally fixated. Pecs\u2014what about the\nrhomboids? Abs\u2014what about the erectors? Quads\u2014what about the glute-ham-\nstring? And for the best of functional movement\u2014punch, jump, throw, run\u2014the\nimpetus comes out of the posterior.\nWe see communities where there is a very deliberate and concerted effort to min-\nimize hip-flexor involvement in exercise. And yet, by insertion and origin, by me-\nchanical position and advantage, and just kinematically, the hip flexors, have\nseveral times the contraction capacity that is estimated of the abdominals. All of it:\nhip extensors, hip flexors, trunk flexors, and ex-\ntensors are essential to midline stabilization. The\nabdominals are just one part of the story.\nFor core strength (midline stabilization), we are"}

There is no trunk-extension work, no hip-extension\nwork, and hip flexion is deliberately limited. Some of these communities also have\nproblems with chronic back injury, which comes at no surprise. If there is anything\nto \u201cmuscle balance,\u201d it makes sense. In how many communities are they doing an\nequal number of deadlifts and squats to their sit-ups? Most of the military/law-en-\nforcement PT is completely devoid of full-range-of-motion hip extension. Rucking,\nrunning, jumping jacks\u2014all will not do it. The run, pull-up, sit-up, push-up, lath-\ner-rinse-repeat PT has no real good core movement. The crunch does not count.\nWhile a cumbersome and space-taking piece of gear, the GHD has been essential\nto our work. We have four of them in 2,500 square feet, so one every 600 feet.\nWe use the GHD for four exercises to heighten awareness and develop capacity\nat midline stabilization. The punchline to the story is that static contractions that\nstabilize the midsection are the most important and functional (powerful) muscu-\nlar contractions in that region. Static contractions for midline stabilization are the\nbest ab exercises known. No amount of crunches are ever going to get you to the\nsame end point as the L-sit, overhead squat, deadlift, etc.\nWhat we suspect is that if you could sequentially fire the abs with the same force\nin any kind of dynamic pattern, you would have the ability to seriously injure your\nspine. If you could ever crunch with the same force that you can stabilize, you\nwould be able to break your back at will. We have come hardwired unable to do\nthat\u2014that is my guess.\nThe movements are presented in the order in which they should be developed in\na client.

Then the back extends sequentially along the spine from \u201csouth\nto north\u201d (Figure 5).\nThis movement does a lot for a coach. It heightens a neurological awareness. It\nallows me to introduce some essential vernacular to the client. If we do not have\ncues that allow me to talk about hip flexion, trunk flexion, hip extension, trunk ex-\ntension, I am fairly worthless with a client. Very early, get clients to know terms. Be\nable to call it out and get the response you need.\nThis movement demonstrates tremendous control. There is hip flexion, hip ex-\ntension, trunk flexion and trunk extension in a combo \u201csnake\u201d move. Using those\nmuscles is essential for midline stabilization and working the posterior.\nThe fourth movement on the GHD is a sit-up but involves no trunk flexion. For the\nGHD sit-up, the pad is set so that the pelvis is free, and the athlete descends back\nto touch the ground and then comes back to seated. More than a few exercise\nphysiologists and certified trainers have observed that this movement is pure hip\nflexion and consequently asserted \u201cthere\u2019s no abs in that.\u201d\nBut what the abs are doing in this exercise is midline stabilization.\nBefore having clients perform the GHD sit-up, ensure they have demonstrated ca-\npacity in the hip extension, back extension, and hip-and-back extension. Even still,\ntheir first GHD sit-ups should be performed in a shortened range of motion, with\nthe trainer spotting behind them (Figure 6). That might be it for the first dose. Once\nthey come back and you can determine the effect from that dose, increase the\nrange of motion and volume as their capacity allows.\nTo perform a GHD sit-up, there is some leg flexion in the descent. Then, the leg\nextends dramatically and pulls the athlete to seated (Figure 7). Conversely, if the\nathlete does not extend the leg to come to seated, the primary movers are the hip"}
{"142": "The force with which an athlete comes up is amazing. Rather than being pulled\nfrom the psoas alone, which is a fairly dysfunctional kind of pull, the athlete uses\nthe full complement of hip-flexor musculature. Any time you are using a fraction of\nthe primary movers responsible for that articulation, it is not natural, not function-\nal, and contrary to nature. Not extending the leg can also be a little irritating to the\nlow back due to this shearing force on the lumbar spine. Performed correctly, the\nmovement is not irritating to the low back. Straightening that leg enables profound\nmusculature to lift from the pelvis.\nThere are people who have this irritation in the spine from a shear force. If you can\nteach them to extend the legs to work the full complement of hip flexors, we will\nmove the margins where this irritation occurs from 3 reps to 4 reps to 10 reps and\nso on. That is rehabilitation. That is neuromuscular re-education.\nThere is an adjunct movement to GHD sit-up in which the athlete is dynamic in the\ntrunk and static in the hip. It is the AbMat sit-up, where we deliberately take the\nhip flexors out of the equation and work the torso dynamically. The hip flexors are\nworking statically or possibly to no significant degree.\nTo do this, the hip flexors need to be removed from the line of action. The fat part\nof the AbMat goes toward the glutes, and the athlete puts the bottom of his or her\nsoles together with the knees butterflied. This positioning makes the hip flexors\ntangential to the line of action; i.e., they cannot do any productive work. This is\ndone deliberately. Then the athlete slowly and under control comes to seated by\ncontracting the abdominals. This is a very dynamic bit of trunk flexion and the hip\nflexors are removed (Figure 8).\nAs the athlete fails, adduct and extend the legs to some degree. This creates more\npurchase for the hip flexors and brings them into the line of action. This allows the\nathlete to modulate the assistance and keep each rep focused on the midsection.\nIf reps are performed slowly and deliberately, most athletes will fail a sit-up with-\nout an AbMat. The failure is not necessarily a neuromuscular failure. It is not"}

But that lum-\nbar region is fairly inflexible, and all that range of motion that is available moves\none from spinally extended through to neutral. There is no more shortening or\nflexion to it; it is not enough to sit up.\nWithout the AbMat, the sit-up is a biphasic movement. While I have solid contact,\nI use upper rectus and create enough momentum to throw the load to the hip\nflexors, where I have more connection. This means that the full rectus has little\nstimulus\u2014it is pulling me from spinally extended through to neutral, but absent\nof any load. The upper rectus is worked where there is a fulcrum, so the back flat-\ntens, but it is the hip flexors that pull me to seated. There is no amount of sit-ups\nyou can do on the ground that is ever going to work you from pubic bone to about\n3 or 4 inches above the belly button. The AbMat moves the athlete from spinally\nextended through to neutral in the lumbar spine against a load.\nHow big would your bench press get if you only pushed air? You would get as\nstrong as your abs will with a ground-based sit-up. With or without the pad, there\nis the same contraction and range of motion in the midsection. Without the pad,\nthe fibers shortened but there was no load and no real work completed. With the\npad, they got the same motion but under a load, and it produced fruitful work.\nThe two sit-ups, GHD and AbMat, complement each other beautifully. One is dy-\nnamic in the hips and static in the trunk; the other is dynamic in the trunk and stat-\nic in the hip. In conjunction with the L-sit (static in the trunk and hip), they develop\na formidable capacity in the midline."}

To communicate knowledge to oth-\ners, a coach must understand what defines proper mechanics and what causes\nbad or inefficient movement. This requires continual study, and one\u2019s teaching will\nimprove with greater understanding in all fields that intersect with fitness.\nAn effective teacher also has a unique ability to relate to every student, regardless\nof his or her background and ability. This requires the teacher to distill a large body\nof knowledge to a single point or a few salient points specific to the current need\nof the athlete and the movement being taught. An effective teacher also takes\nownership for recognizing when communication between the teacher and athlete\nbreaks down. Generally, the more forms of communication a teacher employs\n(verbal, visual, tactile, use of different examples/ analogies, etc.), the more likely\nthe athlete will find success in training.\n2. Seeing\u2014The ability to discern good from poor movement mechanics\nand to identify both gross and subtle faults whether the athlete is in\nmotion or static.\nAn effective trainer demonstrates the ability to see movement and determine\nwhether the mechanics are sound or unsound. This ability first requires knowl-\nedge of when to observe and evaluate very specific aspects of the athlete\u2019s move-\nment (e.g., trunk-to-femur relationship for hip extension, center of pressure on\nfeet for posterior-chain engagement). It also requires knowledge of the differences\nbetween good and poor positions. An effective trainer can see faults both when\nthe athlete is moving (e.g., hip extension) and not moving (e.g., the receiving posi-\ntion of a clean). Newer coaches tend to have the greatest difficulty spotting move-\nment faults while athletes are moving.\n3. Correcting\u2014The ability to facilitate better mechanics for an athlete"}

A trainer needs multiple strategies for each fault because\ndifferent clients often respond to the same cue in a different manner.\nWhen multiple faults occur at once, a trainer is best served by attacking them one\nat a time in order of importance (i.e., triaging). The ordering is based on the se-\nverity of the deviation from ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task; no\nsingle ordering of faults can be used across all athletes and movements. Through-\nout the cueing process, a trainer needs to celebrate small changes or even just\ncelebrate hard work to build rapport and acknowledge a client\u2019s effort even when\nthose efforts are not immediately successful.\nNewer trainers tend to be lacking in their ability to see and correct movement.\nWhen coaching others, trainers need to focus on movement. Good coaches re-\nlentlessly watch movement with a critical eye. Good coaches are constantly ask-\ning the following questions: How could an individual be more efficient and safe?\nWhat cues would result in a better position? How can cues be delivered to produce\nthe best response from the athlete? Good coaches produce noticeable changes in\ntheir athletes\u2019 movement. To develop this critical eye, coaches can work with great\ntrainers, film themselves or other athletes, or film classes.\n4.

{"148": "HOW TO DEVELOP AS A TRAINER\nTo keep up with athletes\u2019 progress, a coach must continue to refine and develop\nhis or her knowledge. If a trainer\u2019s clients are not testing the limits of his or her\nknowledge, the trainer is not doing a good enough job with them. An expert coach\nis eager and proud to have a student exceed his or her abilities but seeks to delay\nit by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the athlete\u2019s\ngrowth. Coaches should focus on development in both academic and practical\nenvironments.\nHere are some suggestions for how trainers can develop:\n1) First and foremost, teach to learn. It is only through experience that\na trainer will learn and gain competency. It is imperative to work with\npeople in a dynamic environment, even if they are friends or family\nin the beginning. Understanding biochemistry, anatomy and teaching\nmethodologies is important and supportive of this endeavor, but it is not\nenough to allow a trainer to apply knowledge in real time.\n2) Watch more experienced coaches\u2014regardless of their specific discipline.\nWatch what they watch and when they watch for it. Listen to their cues.\nThe best coaches often need very few words to produce noticeable\nimprovement in mechanics. Also watch their rapport with clients. What\ndraws clients to them?\n3) Film yourself coaching others. This can also help with your ability to see\nand correct movement faults as you have the luxury of slowing down the\nfootage. Be critical of yourself and use the six criteria detailed above to\nassess strengths and areas for improvement.\n4) Attend a Level 2 Certificate Course (L2). The L2 allows trainers to work\non their coaching (specifically seeing and correcting movement) in the\npresence of their peers. Where the Level 1 Course is important for\nunderstanding the conceptual framework of CrossFit, the goal of the"}

Un-\nder its Certification branch, CrossFit offers courses on topics such as anat-\nomy and physiology and best business practices. Those pursing advanced\ncredentials in CrossFit may use these courses for required continuing-edu-\ncation credits, but the courses are open to anyone.\n6) Read and study everything related to training, movement and health.\n7) Study and follow CrossFit.com. The archives (since 2001) contain years\nof original CrossFit programming. It is a great resource for learning\nand experimenting with workouts. We challenge all trainers to follow\nCrossFit.com programming for at least six months to understand well-\nvaried and challenging CrossFit programming. It provides a good model\nfor the type of workouts, the variance and the volume (i.e., one workout\na day) required for long-term results. It will also provide experience\non how to scale appropriately, as only the most advanced athletes can\ncomplete all CrossFit.com workouts as prescribed (Rx\u2019d).\n8) Pursue higher credentials, such as CrossFit Level 2 Trainer, Certified\nCrossFit Trainer (Level 3) and Certified CrossFit Coach (Level 4). More\ninformation about the Level 2 credential can be found on CrossFit.com/\ncertificate-courses, and more information about the certifications can\nbe found on CrossFit.com/certifications. The CrossFit Level 4 Coach\ncredential is the preeminent trainer designation offered by CrossFit. This\nevaluation provides distinction for expert coaches within the community.\nHOW TO TRAIN OTHERS WHILE GAINING EXPERTISE\nExpert training comes from years of experience and study long after the comple-\ntion of the Level 1 Certificate Course. However, a novice or less experienced person\ncan still train others. Three important principles should guide trainers at all levels:\n\u2022 Master the fundamentals.\n\u2022 Limit the scope.\n\u2022 Pursue excellence."}

These guidelines enable\ntrainers to learn and gain experience while safeguarding the health and well-being\nof people in their care.\nApplying intensity at either end of the spectrum\u2013too much too soon or too little/\nnone at all\u2013blunts the overall benefit from the program. Pushing one\u2019s limits drives\nnew adaptation, and this cannot happen without intensity. On the other hand,\npushing too hard too soon can result in long-term inefficiencies or injury. When\nthe trainer is in doubt, it is better to err on the side of caution and progress slow-\nly. Even at low intensity, many participants see benefits simply from performing\nvaried functional movements, and it will become clear over time when intensity\ncan be added.\nLimit the Scope\nMany CrossFit affiliates follow a group-class model, which can be difficult for a\nnovice coach. The demands of teaching and class management often take the\nattention away from seeing and correcting movement. New trainers are encour-\naged to coach friends and family in individual or small group sessions (two or\nthree athletes) to perfect their ability to improve mechanics before taking on large\ngroup classes. Another option is to assist a head coach for classes and small-group\ntraining. The new trainer can improve his or her ability to discern poor move-\nment and cue good movement, while the head trainer addresses the other logis-\ntics. New trainers should seek out internships or assistant roles at local affiliates\nto gain this experience.

Rather than devising a business model in the pur-\nsuit of money, devise one that is focused on making the training (and, by exten-\nsion, the clients) better. The most effective business plan comes from achieving\nexcellence and letting the market bring the money to you.\nTo pursue excellence, ask the question, \u201cWhat would make the training or the af-\nfiliate better?\u201d An analysis of pros and cons can muddle every decision, and most\nissues can be decided by a simple question: \u201cWill it improve the quality of the pro-\ngramming or the training experience?\u201d If the answer is \u201cYes!\u201d you are most likely\npursuing excellence.\nCROSSFIT COMMUNITY AND REPRESENTATION\nThe Level 1 Certificate Course is a great way to formalize one\u2019s involvement in\nthe CrossFit community.

Rhabdo-\nmyolysis (often simply referred to as \u201crhabdo\u201d) is a medical condition that might\narise from breakdown of muscle tissue and release of the muscle cells\u2019 contents\ninto the bloodstream. This process can damage the kidneys and can lead to renal\nfailure or death in rare cases. Rhabdo is diagnosed when a patient with an appro-\npriate history has an elevated level of creatine kinase, also known as CK or CPK.\nCPK is easier to measure in the blood than myoglobin and is generally used as a\nmarker for rhabdo, even though it is the myoglobin that does the damage.\nTreatment consists of generous amounts of intravenous (IV) fluids to dilute and\nflush the myoglobin through the kidneys. In the worst cases, patients might need\ndialysis while the kidneys recover. Death, though rare, can result when kidney fail-\nure causes imbalances in the usual electrolytes, which can cause cardiac arrhyth-\nmias. Most patients make a complete recovery after being rehydrated with IV fluids\nover anywhere from several hours to a week or so, depending on the severity.\nThere are a few ways a CrossFit trainer can protect athletes from rhabdomyolysis:\n\u2022 Follow the charter of mechanics, consistency, intensity.\n\u2022 Know the movements that have a higher rate of rhabdomyolysis incidence\n(those that prolong the eccentric contraction), and be mindful of the total"}

At affiliates where there are \u201celements\u201d or \u201con-ramp\u201d classes that last a\ncouple of weeks, athletes should still be heavily scaled beyond this introductory\nperiod to ensure adequate time to acclimate to CrossFit training. If there are no\nseparate classes for beginners, treat the workouts as technique sessions for new-\ner athletes\u2013focus on their mechanics rather than speed or load. There is no set\nprotocol for how quickly to increase intensity, but it is wise to err on the side of\ncaution and work toward long-term fitness. Multiple months at scaled loads and\nvolumes are well within a normal timeframe for even the best athletes, with gradu-\nal increases in intensity implemented after that. Trainers need to frequently check\nin with athletes to determine how the previous dose of exercise affected them.\nAlthough intensity is a significant part of CrossFit, each athlete has his or her entire\nlife to continue to improve fitness and tolerance for intensity.\nThe second way to mitigate the risk of rhabdomyolysis is to know the movements\nassociated with a higher rate of incidence. Beginner athletes should keep \u201cnega-\ntives\u201d (movements which prolong the eccentric phase) to a minimum. Although\nnegatives can be an effective way to increase strength, they should not be used\nin high volumes with beginners. Athletes may increase the volume of negatives\ngradually over time.\nWhile the eccentric phase of movements cannot and should not be avoided, there\nare movements in which people are more likely to prolong the eccentric phase. In\nCrossFit, these tend to be jumping pull-ups and full-range-of-motion glute-ham de-\nveloper (GHD) sit-ups. In the jumping pull-up, the athlete should not prolong the\ndescent but should instead immediately drop to an extended-arm position once\nthe chin has cleared the bar, absorbing the impact with the legs. Similarly, in the\nfull-range-of-motion GHD sit-up, newer athletes should use fewer repetitions and\npotentially a shortened range of motion until capacity is developed. It is also prudent\nfor trainers to scale the number of repetitions and the range of motion for athletes\nwho do not routinely use GHD sit-ups regardless of their CrossFit experience. There\nare no exact rules for total volume, but beginners and new CrossFit athletes (and\neven advanced CrossFit athletes who have not been routinely using the GHD) should"}

Certain medications, in-\ncluding statins (cholesterol-lowering agents), increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis.\nSymptoms of rhabdomyolysis include severe generalized muscle pain, nausea\nand vomiting, abdominal cramping, and, in severe cases, dark-red or cola-colored\nurine. The discoloration of the urine comes from the muscle\u2019s myoglobin, which is\nthe same molecule that gives red meat its color. If these symptoms appear follow-\ning a workout (or at any time with regard to dark-red urine), the athlete should seek\nmedical attention immediately.\nThe athletes at highest risk seem to be those with a reasonable baseline level of\nfitness obtained through some non-CrossFit training, those who are returning to\nCrossFit after a layoff, or even experienced CrossFit athletes who reach volume\nor intensity significantly outside their established \u201cnorm.\u201d These athletes have\nsufficient muscle mass and conditioning to create enough intensity to hurt them-\nselves. Generally, the most deconditioned seem to be at less risk (but not zero). It\nis suspected they do not have enough muscle mass or the capacity to generate\nhigh levels of intensity.

Very real risks exist\nfrom equipment condition, use, and arrangement, as well as from improper spot-\nting of athletes during movements.\nEquipment condition refers both to installation and day-to-day maintenance.

Trainers must repair, replace, and discontinue use of faulty\nequipment immediately.\nArrangement refers to the layout of equipment and athletes during a class or\nworkout. Each athlete needs enough space to perform the movements, with an\nadditional buffer to account for the errant-moving equipment, missed attempts,\nand safe passage of coaches or other athletes. Under no circumstances should a\ntrainer permit extra equipment like bars, plates, boxes, etc. to be left lying around\nthe workout area. This equipment might trip athletes or cause a ricochet if other\nequipment lands on it.\nIt is also imperative for a trainer to prepare for falls during dynamic movements. It is\npossible that an athlete might lose his or her grip during a kip (pull-up or muscle-up).\nTrainers might encourage athletes to wrap their thumbs around any bar in an ef-\nfort to provide additional feedback to the athlete. This is not foolproof, however,\nand can sometimes be even less secure, particularly for athletes with small hands.\nWhatever the hand position chosen, it does not replace the need for the athlete to\ndevelop body awareness of when to end the movement if his or her grip is compro-\nmised (wrapping thumbs is always recommended for barbell and ring movements\nto help provide better balance and control, especially in higher-risk scenarios such\nas a bench press or muscle-up). Boxes and racks should not be beneath, behind or\ndirectly in front of these athletes. Adjustable rings should be lowered to the appro-\npriate height. Where assistance boxes are necessary, they are best placed to the side\nof the working athlete (and not in another athlete\u2019s way) to leave a clear path should\nan athlete leave the apparatus prematurely. A suggestion for trainers trying to man-\nage these risks is to do a \u201cdry run\u201d of the workout before it begins: check the working\nspace for each athlete for each of the proposed movements. This can be as simple as\norganizing the class to rotate stations on the trainer\u2019s call and perform a quick walk-\nthrough to check spacing and arrangement. Trainers can then instruct participants\nto move to the same spot during the workout to ensure safety.\nAthletes also need instruction regarding how to bail safely from lifts and how to\nspot other athletes where appropriate.

A blood-spill clean-\nup procedure can be found in the CrossFit Journal archives.\nMONITORING ATHLETES FOR CONDITIONS THAT NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION\nAlthough a trainer is primarily there to instruct and improve athlete movements,\nhe or she needs to monitor the level of exertion during the workout and ensure\nathlete health is protected. As CrossFit workouts use relatively high intensity, ath-\nletes are working at their physical and psychological tolerances. It is possible for\nathletes to push too hard, and confounding environmental factors might exacer-\nbate certain situations.\nExtreme temperature fluctuations, especially heat, can be problematic. Trainers\nshould be ready in unseasonably hot and humid weather with sufficient water, and\nthey should watch for common signs of overexertion (e.g., dizziness). Hot weather\nalso increases the potential risk for rhabdomyolysis (although some cases have\noccurred in cold climates), and trainers should encourage athletes to stay hydrated\n(with the caveat that they should not be excessively hydrated. Current mainstream\nliterature suggests rates of 1.2 L/hour, which are actually too high and can lead to\noverhydration). In the event of a potential heat stroke following a workout (e.g.,\nathlete demonstrates an altered mental state), a trainer should remove excess\nclothing from the athlete and then douse him or her with cool water before med-\nical attention arrives.\nWeather aside, other conditions might need medical attention. Symptoms such\nas numbness or chronic pain in joints and muscles should be referred to medical\nprofessionals. Medical attention is immediately necessary for any non-respon-\nsive athlete."}
{"158": "We advise against rehydration strategies that encourage consumption of fluids to\nprevent loss of body-weight during activity. Dehydration during physical activity is\na normal physiological process, and the thirst mechanism is sufficient in regulating\nhydration and serum sodium concentration during exercise.\nDrinking beyond thirst in an attempt to prevent body-weight loss during exercise\noffers no benefit to health or performance. It also presents a serious risk of ex-\nercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), a potentially deadly dilution of the body\u2019s\nserum sodium concentration. EAH is caused by overconsumption of fluid and can\nbe viewed as an iatrogenic condition due to the prevailing belief that exercising\nathletes should drink \u201cas much fluid as tolerable\u201d during training.\n\u201cFluid\u201d that can contribute to EAH includes electrolyte-enhanced sports drinks.\nContrary to popular belief, these commercial beverages do not reduce risk of hy-\nponatremia. Because of flavoring and sugar content, these drinks might present\ngreater risk for overconsumption of fluid than water alone, increasing the risk of\npotentially deadly EAH in athletes.\nSPECIAL POPULATIONS\nAny potential athlete with a medical condition needs to be cleared by a physician for\nexercise before a trainer recommends a fitness regimen.

Virtuosity is defined in gymnas-\ntics as \u201cperforming the common uncommonly well.\u201d Unlike risk and originality,\nvirtuosity is elusive, supremely elusive. It is, however, readily recognized by the\naudience as well as coaches and athletes. But more importantly, more to my point,\nvirtuosity is more than the requirement for that last tenth of a point; it is always\nthe mark of true mastery (and of genius and beauty).\nThere is a compelling tendency among novices developing any skill or art, whether\nlearning to play the violin, write poetry, or compete in gymnastics, to quickly move\npast the fundamentals and on to more elaborate, more sophisticated movements,\nskills, or techniques. This compulsion is the novice\u2019s curse\u2013the rush to original-\nity and risk.\nThe novice\u2019s curse is manifested as excessive adornment, silly creativity, weak\nfundamentals and, ultimately, marked lack of virtuosity and delayed mastery.

{"162": "PROFESSIONAL TRAINING\nOriginally published in January 2006.\nI am a fitness trainer. My practice is more\nthan just a job; it is my passion. My clients\nare my top priority and their successes\nare my life\u2019s work\u2013I am a professional.\nOn the surface, my job is to shepherd my\nathletes (I view all my clients as athletes\nregardless of their age or ability) toward\nphysical prowess, but I recognize a pur-\npose to my efforts and an impact on my\nathletes that transcends the physical.\nI view training as a physical metaphor\nfor habits and attitudes that foster suc-\ncess in all arenas. I stress that point to\nall who train with me, and I know I have\nbeen successful only after they bring\nback concrete examples.\nThe lessons learned through physical training are unavoidable. The character\ntraits required and developed through physical training are universally applicable\nto all endeavors. Perseverance, industry, sacrifice, self-control, integrity, honesty,\nand commitment are best and easiest learned in the gym. Even clients who have\nfound spectacular success in business, sport, war, or love find their most import-\nant values buttressed, refined, and nourished in rigorous training.\nBeing a professional, I believe that my competency is solely determined by my\nefficacy.

{"163": "My commitment to my athletes is clearly expressed and perceived in our first\nmeeting. I am all theirs. They are the object of my focus and the focus of my con-\nversation. They come back not because of my physical capacity but because they\nbelieve in my capacity to develop theirs. World-class athletes rarely make world-\nclass trainers.\nI understand that the modern and near-universal trend of skill-less and low-skill\nprogramming delivers inferior results and makes cheerleaders of trainers. I will\nhave none of it. I have to understand the mechanics, cues, and techniques of com-\nplex movements and to be able to teach them to others. I bring a skill set to my\ntraining that scares off most trainers.\nKeeping up with my athletes\u2019 progress demands that I continue to refine and ad-\nvance my understanding of advanced skills. If a trainer\u2019s clients are not testing\nthe limits of his knowledge, he is not doing a good enough job with them. The\nmaster trainer is eager and proud to have a student exceed his abilities but seeks\nto delay it by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the\nathlete\u2019s growth.\nBecause I want my clients\u2019 training experience to transcend the physical realm,\nI am obligated to understand their jobs, hobbies, families, and goals. Motivating\nclients to transcend fitness requires that I be involved in their lives. This is not go-\ning to happen without my being both interested in them and interesting to them.\nBeing a voracious reader of books, newspapers, and magazines, I have no short-\nage of conversation, ideas, and knowledge to share, and so you will find me at my\nclients\u2019 parties, weddings, and family gatherings. Indeed, I am a personal friend to\nnearly every one of my clients. This is extremely gratifying work and often emo-\ntionally charged, but that is all right because I am an integral part of my athletes\u2019\nlives, and life is full of laughter, tears, and hope.\nOur friendship, the fun we have, and the frequency of our contact, coupled with\nthe scope of fitness\u2019s impact and the technical merits of my training, contribute to"}

More than just the\nbackbone of CrossFit\u2019s strength and successes, it has been, we believe, the prima-\nry reason for our success.\nUsing this template, we built a practice that kept us both busy from roughly\n5 to 10 a.m. Monday through Saturday. That schedule produced a low-six-figure in-\ncome, which is really amazing given that we got to work together, with our friends,\nhaving a positive impact on people\u2019s lives, and keep afternoons free for family,\nrecreation, and study.\nTraining with the attention and commitment that we bring to our practice, though\nfun and immensely rewarding, is also draining, and five appointments per day is\nabout all we could handle without an unacceptable drop in energy, focus, and,\nconsequently, professional standards.\nEventually, the demand for our training exceeded the time we were professionally\nable or willing to allot. In an effort to accommodate more athletes, we began to\nhold group classes.\nWe had used group classes to train some of our athletic teams, and everyone\nloved them, trainers and athletes alike.

They also seem to have an inordinate\ndifficulty filling their classes.\nThis is exactly how we built our group classes. After working for years at the limit\nof our one-on-one capacity, we started accepting new clients by doubling them up\nwith other one-on-one clients to form one-on-two appointments.\nWe introduced the shift to group classes by telling the existing one-on-one clients\nthat we had good news for them: \u201cYour training rate is going to go down and we\u2019re\ngoing to introduce you to a new friend.\u201d Where there was resistance to sharing the\ntime we asked for a trial period.

Seeing builds on this knowledge by\nrequiring the trainer to assess these points of performance (and deviation from\nthem) in real time. Correcting is the ability to improve a client\u2019s mechanics to better\nadhere to the points of performance.\nEach movement has at least two sections: 1) Points of Performance; and 2) Com-\nmon Faults and Corrections.

{"15": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nFOUNDATIONS OF EFFECTIVE TRAINING\nWhereas the Level 1 Certificate Course provides an introduction to functional movements and CrossFit methodol-\nogy, the Level 2 Course is focused on improving a trainer\u2019s ability to coach others.\nA trainer\u2019s ability to coach others rests on capacity in six different areas:\n\u2022 Teaching\n\u2022 Seeing\n\u2022 Correcting\n\u2022 Group Management\n\u2022 Presence and Attitude\n\u2022 Demonstration\nThe depth and breadth of a trainer\u2019s capacity in each area affects not only whether clients become more fit but also\nthe degree to which the clients become more fit. Effectiveness can be assessed by asking whether clients optimize\nwork capacity across broad time and modal domains (i.e., whether a client becomes as fit and healthy as possible)\nA newer trainer may have only rudimentary capacity in each area and clients still will see results because of the\ninherent benefits of performing constantly varied functional movements at high intensity. An effective trainer, on\nthe other hand, has the ability to safeguard health and improve performance for a client beyond what he or she\ncould do alone.\nAlthough these areas can be described and defined independently (below), there is a natural overlap among them in\na real-time coaching environment. A deficiency in any one area can inhibit a trainer\u2019s success. Even a weakness in one\narea relative to the others blunts the trainer\u2019s overall reach. For example, a trainer with tremendous knowledge and\ntechnical skill (teaching, seeing, and correcting) will still have difficulty retaining members if there is little persona\nconnection with them (presence and attitude).\nRegardless of a trainer\u2019s current level of proficiency, a commitment to improving each area is the hallmark of a\nsuccessful trainer. Similar to the athlete\u2019s path to refining and improving movement mechanics, a trainer must refine\ncoaching skills across a career to become great. Doing so develops virtuosity in coaching.\nTEACHING\nThe ability to effectively articulate and instruct the mechanics of each movement, including the ability to focus on major\npoints of performance before more subtle or nuanced ones. It also includes the ability to change instruction based on\nthe athlete\u2019s needs and capacity.\nTo teach functional movements, a trainer must first understand what defines proper mechanics and what may cause\npoor movement. A trainer must know ideal positions, but more frequently a trainer\u2019s job is to teach athletes how to\nimprove poor positions and movement patterns.\nKnowledge in fitness-related areas\nBeyond movement mechanics, trainers can also instruct clients in other areas that may improve their fitness. Greater\nknowledge in any field that overlaps with fitness\u2014such as anatomy and physiology, nutrition, or even expertise in"}
{"16": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\na certain sport\u2014can aid a trainer\u2019s teaching. The more athletically advanced the athlete, the greater the depth of\nknowledge needed for a trainer to produce additional fitness gains. Continued research, education, and practical\nexperience over the course of a career develop a breadth of knowledge applicable to any athlete, from beginner to elite.\nTeaching demands not only possessing knowledge but also the ability to impart it to others. Knowledge alone does\nnot make one an effective teacher. Successful teaching hinges on a trainer\u2019s ability to accurately convey as much of\nthat knowledge as possible to others.\nEffective communication\nTo convey knowledge effectively, a teacher must be able to change his or her communication style to meet the\ncapacity of the student, regardless of his or her background, ability, and learning style. This is why trainers are\nbest served by using different means of communication\u2014visual and verbal teaching, for example\u2014to aid learning.\nImplicit in the trainer-athlete dialogue is the trainer taking responsibility for when communication with the athlete\nbreaks down. It is the trainer\u2019s responsibility to guide and lead the athlete, and it is the athlete\u2019s responsibility to be\ncommitted to the process. However, if the athlete is clearly frustrated with the instruction, the trainer must change\nstrategies or communication style until the athlete succeeds.\nA trainer can also assess the effectiveness of teaching and communication by determining whether the athlete meets\nperformance expectations. If no one in a group moves to the level the trainer expects, he or she needs to reevaluate\nthe instruction. It is often not the athlete\u2019s fault. A good teacher can use effective communication to prevent a large\npercentage of problems from occurring. For example, it is often effective to break complex movements down into\na progression or logical teaching steps that allow the athlete to practice pieces that naturally build on one another.\nA teacher who shows an athlete a barbell clean, describes it in its entirety, and then asks the class to replicate it can\nexpect few (if any) to match the instruction. Conversely, using a progression\u2014such as that demonstrated for the\nmedicine-ball clean at the Level 1 Course\u2014will get more athletes to demonstrate the gross mechanics quickly. These\nprogressions can often help a trainer focus on seeing certain faults as well.\nTeaching as much as is necessary often means the teacher must reduce and simplify his or her body of knowledge\nto the one or two most salient points at that moment for that particular athlete. With fast-paced human movement,\nchange is often hampered by long and detailed explanations when simple, broad-brush instructions are more digest-\nible. This does not mean a trainer\u2019s knowledge of the system should be simple; it is the explanation that should be.\nA trainer can ask himself or herself, \u201cWhat is the one thing this athlete needs right now?\u201d The answer will change as\nprogress is made.\nseeing\nThe ability to distinguish good from poor movement mechanics and identify both gross and subtle faults whether the\nathlete is in motion or static.\nA trainer who can effectively assess the mechanical positions as sound or unsound throughout movement has\ncapacity in seeing. Seeing is the necessary first step for a trainer to bring about change in a client\u2019s mechanics, but it\nrests on one\u2019s teaching capacity (knowledge). Trainers must first know positions of best mechanical leverage, as well\nas the effect of varying anthropometrics on these positions. If a trainer does not know what to look for, he or she will\nnot see correctible issues."}
{"17": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nStatic faults\nThe trainer must also use visual-recognition skills throughout the repetition, whether the athlete is static or dynamic\nStatic positions are the points at which the athlete is not moving, even briefly. Static positions usually occur near\nthe end ranges of motion\u2014either in the starting, receiving, or finishing positions\u2014or when there is a brief pause or\ndecreased speed, often due to a change of direction. Static positions include the setup position for a deadlift or the\nbottom of a squat, for example. Correctly identifying faults is easier in static positions because these positions give\ntrainers more time for assessment.\nDynamic faults\nDynamic positions find the athlete moving between the static positions, often at high speed. Examples of faults\nseen in dynamic movements include not reaching full hip extension in the drive phase of a clean, pressing early in a\npush press, or initiating the squat with the knees. These dynamic faults are more difficult to identify because of the\ndecreased time for assessment. The trainer must also know when and where to see faults during the movement. For\nexample, a trainer needs to see that the athlete has the weight on the heels during the drive phase of a push jerk\nbut the trainer is also evaluating the trunk-to-femur relationship for hip extension, the bar path relative to the fronta\nplane, and a whole host of other relationships. Generally, a profile view of the athlete (offset by about 45 degrees)\nis the most useful view to assess the athlete\u2019s mechanics, but trainers should not be limited to using this view only.\nThe difficulty in seeing dynamic faults increases as:\n1. the athlete moves more quickly, and\n2. the faults become more subtle.\nYears of experience help a trainer effectively coach any level of athlete. New trainers may use a few methods to\ndevelop their ability to see faults, particularly dynamic faults. One method is to study film. Slow the movement down\nto a series of static frames. A trainer may choose to film his or her own athletes or simply watch footage available\non the internet. Replaying the footage in real time after observing the movement in a static series can help bridge\nthe gap between seeing static and dynamic positions. Another strategy for newer trainers is to methodically survey\nathletes for only one fault at a time. For example, when teaching athletes the push jerk, the trainer may choose to\nwatch only for hip extension during the first several repetitions. Then, the trainer may choose to watch and see if\nthe athletes drive through their heels. Over time, trainers can observe multiple faults simultaneously (e.g., lack of hip\nextension or not having the weight on the heels), but initially, trying to see everything often results in seeing nothing\nSimilarly, newer trainers generally find more success by watching one athlete at a time per repetition instead of\nscanning multiple athletes with every repetition.\nCorreCTing\nThe ability to facilitate better mechanics for an athlete using visual, verbal, and/or tactile cues. This includes the ability\nto triage (prioritize) faults in order of importance, which requires an understanding of how multiple faults are related.\nThe ability of a trainer to facilitate improved mechanics is dependent on capacities in teaching and seeing. Teaching\nreflects a trainer\u2019s knowledge of proper mechanics; seeing reflects a trainer\u2019s ability to discern these positions in rea\ntime. If capacity is limited in either, it follows that the trainer\u2019s capacity in correcting will also be weak.\nCorrecting mechanics results in both increased performance gains and decreased risk of injury. A trainer can expect\nto correct an athlete\u2019s mechanics forever; mechanics can be infinitely refined to create ever more efficient positions"}
{"18": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nas the athlete progresses. CrossFit trainers should strive for excellent mechanics in their clients and avoid settling for\n\u201cOK\u201d movement. This means a trainer must be able to correct both gross and subtle deviations in all levels of athletes\nThey must set a high standard for good movement and be relentless in the constant pursuit of improvement.\nCorrecting hinges on the trainer\u2019s ability to:\n1. use successful cues,\n2. know multiple corrections for each fault,\n3. triage faulty movement, and\n4. balance critique with praise.\nCues\nAny cue that results in improved movement mechanics is successful and therefore a good cue. There are no specific\nformulas, formats, or rules to follow for cues, and their value is based on the result. A cue\u2019s primary function is to\nhelp the athlete execute perfect mechanics, not to perfectly describe the mechanics of the movement. For example\none may say \u201cweight in heels\u201d to help a person shift weight back and better achieve pressure across the foot (versus\non the toes). Generally, making cues short, specific, and actionable tends to result in a greater success rate. Short\nspecific, and actionable cues are useful because the trainer gives a single task for the athlete to complete. An example\nof this type of cue is, \u201cPush your knees out.\u201d It is short (four words), specific to a body part (knees), and also indicates\naction and/or direction (out). It is easy for the athlete to respond to a cue such as this, even when performing a com-\nplicated movement.\nIt is possible for a trainer to confuse cueing with fault identification. For example, pointing out the fault that is pres-\nent\u2014\u201cYour knees are caving in\u201d\u2014does not tell the athlete how to fix it. An experienced athlete may be able to make\nthe leap from hearing the identification of the fault to then fixing it, but this translation from fault identification to\nspecific direction is ultimately the trainer\u2019s responsibility.\nTrainers may also rely on more technical language in their cues (i.e., \u201cYou are losing your midline\u201d), which assumes the\nathlete has a significant amount of fitness-related knowledge. While such language may give the appearance of being\nmore technical (and perhaps represents an attempt to sound more intelligent), it is at best a vague verbal cue. Cues\nshould be kept to simple language that is easily understood by anyone. Non-specific language is also best avoided\nin cues. Something such as, \u201cGet tight!\u201d or \u201cChest!\u201d can be meaningless to the athlete, especially in the absence of\ninstruction on how to \u201cget tight\u201d or where and how to move the chest.\nA basic three-step process for developing short, specific, and actionable cues is:\n1. identify the fault,\n2. identify what is out of place (be specific: name the body part), and\n3. give direction to that body part.\nAs stated before, \u201cPush your knees out\u201d is a short, specific, and actionable cue.\nHowever, even with short, specific, and actionable cues, there is no guarantee the athlete\u2019s movement will improve\nThe trainer needs to use multiple cues until the fault is resolved. There are cases in which a cue that is effective for\none athlete is ineffective for another, and in other cases, even a good cue may result in poor movement. \u201cGet your"}

Nevertheless, some athletes interpret this cue to mean that the weight should be on their heels exclusively\nand they fall backwards or lose their balance. That does not mean the cue was bad or the trainer was wrong; it means\nthe trainer has to try an alternative cue.\nA trainer should not be limited to a certain set of cues for a specific fault, and he or she should continue to use differ-\nent cues until the movement improves. Over time, a trainer develops corrective strategies, building a bank of options\nfor every fault. These corrective strategies should include verbal (i.e., speaking), visual (i.e., showing), and tactile\n(i.e., touching) cues, all of which may be employed to fix the same fault but may be interpreted differently among\nathletes. Verbal cues tell the athlete a specific instruction, visual cues create contrasting images between current and\npreferred positioning, and tactile cues use physical targets to achieve proper mechanics. The greater the number of\nstrategies a trainer can employ for any fault, the more likely it is that he or she will be successful in correcting the fault\nTriaging faults\nDetermining which single fault to correct can be a challenge, as multiple faults often occur together. Ideally, every\nfault would be addressed simultaneously, but this is unrealistic in practice. The trainer is best served by triaging\nfaults. The term \u201ctriaging\u201d is most often used in medicine to assign urgency to those needing medical attention\nTriaging when coaching movement means assigning urgency to the multiple faults present in order of the most to\nleast important. Greater importance is assigned to faults that have the highest risk for injury (and, therefore, also the\ngreatest potential to limit performance). In a loaded environment, there are many cases in which the fault to address\nfirst would be loss of a neutral spine, usually in flexion. However, a flexed lumbar curve at depth in an air squat is less\nconcerning than that same position in a loaded back squat. This athlete needs to continue to air squat to full depth\nfighting for a neutral midline, all while maintaining the range of motion required by life. It is precisely the practice of\nthe movement, even with less-than-ideal mechanics, that will eventually allow him or her to reclaim positions that\ncan be loaded. In this example, completing the full range of motion was given more priority than midline stabilization\nThe ordering is based on the severity of the deviation from the ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task\nthere is no single ordering of faults that can be used across all athletes in all applications.\nWhichever fault the trainer decides to fix first should become the trainer\u2019s focus. He or she has to selectively ignore\nthe other faults present. Once that fault is fixed or mitigated at least to the degree that it is no longer the most import-\nant, the trainer can move on to the next issue.\nAfter choosing which fault to address, the trainer needs to know how the various faults are related. A trainer may\ncue a different body part than the one he or she is trying to fix due to the interrelatedness of movement mechanics\nSuppose an athlete performs an air squat with the following faults: weight shifting forward, knees collapsing, and\nback rounding. The trainer needs to consider: Are the caving knees causing the back to round? Is the rounded back\ncausing the weight to shift forward? Perhaps the trainer chooses to address the back position first but actually tells\nthe athlete, \u201cPush the knees out.\u201d There are cases in which allowing more room for the pelvis helps create a neutra\nspine position.\nAssess the cue\u2019s effectiveness and provide feedback\nAfter a trainer delivers a cue, he or she must stay with that athlete for at least another repetition to assess the result\nWhatever the athlete\u2019s response, the trainer needs to provide feedback. A trainer needs to let the athlete know if\nthe movement was the same, better, or worse. If the movement improves, a trainer needs to acknowledge that"}
{"20": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nperhaps with, \u201cThat\u2019s better\u201d or, \u201cGood correction.\u201d This helps the athlete develop kinesthetic awareness of proper\npositioning. In some cases, an athlete may improve movement but not to the desired degree. Encouraging these\nathletes simply to give more in that same direction is often a sound strategy (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s better, but even lower!\u201d). If\nthe movement has not changed, this could be addressed simply by saying, \u201cNot there yet\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019ll come back to you,\u201d\nfor example. An unsuccessful cue should not be repeated multiple times with a single athlete; instead, the trainer\nshould find a new cue. If the movement changes for the worse, the trainer also needs to immediately recognize this\nand stop or reverse it (e.g., \u201cOther way\u201d).\nNot staying to assess the effectiveness of a cue and provide the athlete with feedback is almost the same as not\ngiving a cue at all. If a trainer tells an athlete to do something and walks away before seeing the result, he or she may\nmiss it when a cue results in no change or even change for the worse. The athlete has no idea if his or her efforts\nhave resulted in improvement. All feedback, positive and negative, is tied to the athlete developing better kinesthetic\nawareness. Precision of word choice is critical. The use of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d needs to be reserved for actual sound or\nimproved mechanics and not used as a filler.\nThroughout the cueing process, a trainer must also be aware when praise for hard work (regardless of change) is\nnecessary. There are cases where no change or only a very slight change occurs in a session. Celebrating the effort\nacknowledges the hard work put forth that day and helps a client remain willing to continue to work hard. A trainer\njust needs to be clear when the praise is for the effort rather than a movement that still needs improvement.\ngrouP ManageMenT\nThe ability to organize and manage, both at a micro level (within each class) and at the macro level (the gym as a\nwhole). This includes managing time well; organizing the space, equipment, and participants for optimal flow and\nexperience; planning ahead; etc.\nGroup management is not just about organizing logistical considerations for a class so clients have enough space\ntime, and equipment to complete the workout. It is about optimally managing these variables to support the best\npossible instruction (see \u201cComponents of an Effective Class\u201d). Poor planning of any aspect of a class\u2014for example\nthe amount of time spent on certain parts, how the equipment is set up, and how much time is allotted to each par-\nticipant\u2014can detract from the quality of the experience.\nAdhere to the schedule\nAt its most basic level, effective group management means adhering to posted schedules. Clients plan their sched-\nules around these announced times, and it should not be assumed that they have more time or flexibility. Adhering\nto posted times means both starting and ending on time: Running over is as unacceptable as starting late. Ending\nlate usually occurs when a trainer does not plan ahead and think through the entire class schedule. Adhering to the\nschedule also includes the schedule within each class. Following a simple template (such as introduction, warm-up\nworkout, and post-workout) every class helps ensure necessary time is devoted to each piece (see \u201cComponents of\nan Effective Class\u201d). The trainer may also consider the experience level of the class to determine which pieces need\nmore time or less time during instruction.\nSpace and equipment layout\nGroup management also includes variables such as space layout and equipment availability. The layout needs to\naccount for buffer zones around any equipment in use and should also take into account when athletes have to move"}
{"21": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nto different areas of the gym during the workout. The class size often dictates which workouts are realistic given the\nequipment and space. Even in cases in which neither is limited, an effective trainer should have pre-determined alter-\nnatives for any class workout should a larger number of participants show up unexpectedly.\nGroup management speaks to the trainer\u2019s ability to reduce the logistical setup and preparation time during a class to\nmaximize the amount of teaching and movement time. This means the trainer plans ahead and perhaps prearranges\na complicated workout with multiple pieces of equipment and/or weights. Spending several or more minutes sorting\nequipment takes away from a trainer\u2019s time to instruct, improve, and refine movement.\nPlan how and what to teach\nTime spent on instruction can also reduce the client\u2019s practice time. A trainer needs to plan how and what to teach to\nmaximize the client\u2019s time moving. Allowing for enough practice time every class is necessary for both the trainer and\nclient. Less practice time gives the trainer less time to observe and cue movement mechanics, as well as less time for\na client to work on movement with improved form. Change in mechanics comes from continual cueing across many\nrepetitions.\nDuring every class, the trainer also needs to manage the attention given to each participant. Every student should\nfeel that he or she received enough attention. While some clients need more time than others, even good movers\nwith subtle inefficiencies need to be coached, pushed for higher speed and/or loads, or praised for sound perfor-\nmance. Attention still benefits them. To assist with each client getting enough individual attention, a helpful tool is\nto keep the group on the trainer\u2019s cadence for all repetitions during the warm-up or skill work. Controlling when the\ngroup moves ensures the same number of repetitions are completed by everyone. It also allows the trainer to sys-\ntematically and selectively observe individuals and specific aspects of their movement.\nThe size of the class affects how much time a trainer can spend with each person, but the class size should not be\nbeyond the trainer\u2019s capacity. The demands of large classes often turn trainers into crowd herders, timekeepers and\ncheerleaders who have little time to spend on cueing individual movement faults. Newer trainers (those with less\nthan two years of experience) can rarely find success when stepping into classes of 10-plus participants. In his article\n\u201cScaling Professional Training,\u201d CrossFit Founder Greg Glassman explained that after years of one-on-one persona\ntraining produced groups of two, eventually groups of three, and so on, his classes continued to grow until growth\nresulted in \u201cperceived reduction in attention\u201d to each paying member.\nRegardless of experience, trainers should make an honest assessment of the time and attention given to each client\nafter each training session.

If the answer to either question is no, the session was likely too large for the trainer\nThe goal is to maximize a trainer\u2019s effectiveness and reach.\nPresenCe and aTTiTude\nThe ability to create a positive and engaging learning environment, showing empathy for athletes and creating rapport\n\u201cPresence and attitude\u201d refers to the trainer\u2019s ability to create a positive atmosphere and develop a rapport with each\nclient. Although more subjective than the other five areas of effective training, developing a positive presence and\nattitude is equally if not more important."}
{"22": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nKnow your clients\nAn effective trainer recognizes that each person has different abilities, insecurities, needs, and goals; he or she also\nhas the awareness and interpersonal skills to respond accordingly. The trainer recognizes that individuals respond\ndifferently to instruction and critique and makes it his or her responsibility to determine how best to relate to and\nmotivate each individual regardless of background and ability.\nA trainer must be aware of whether each client is interested in each class; a client\u2019s needs may change with the days\nand external life demands. The trainer should know what is happening with most of the group most of the time, and\nthis goes beyond movement mechanics. This includes issues such as who is struggling that day due to external pres-\nsures or stress, who has high energy, who is aloof or annoyed, who is new to the gym, etc. All these factors may affect\nthe degree to which the athletes can perform relative to their usual capacity. Effective trainers know these things\nbecause they routinely interact with their clients and are invested in their relationships with them.\nA common trait of trainers with a positive presence and attitude is that they genuinely care about their clients\u2019 success\nThis care means more to clients than the trainer\u2019s knowledge. Many clients have little interest in the technical aspects\nof training. Their interests often lie in unrelated professions and hobbies, and they are at the gym to improve the\nquality of their lives. The mechanisms of their success in the gym are much less important to them than the results\nand success itself. In addition to seeing results, clients know if they feel welcomed and cared for, respected, inspired\nand motivated. They can sense whether the trainer has their best interests at heart.\nBe authentic\nA positive presence and attitude cannot be faked; it comes from a sincere passion for service. It can take on many\nforms based on the trainer\u2019s personality and interpersonal skills. Trainers should not interpret this as being any single\ntrait, such as loud, funny, or bubbly. Trainers are encouraged to be authentic. There is room for any personality type\nto succeed if a trainer couples genuine caring with awareness of his or her limitations and recognizes the effect he\nor she may have on clients. This may motivate a trainer to become a better version of himself or herself. A trainer\nmay set personal goals to compensate for any perceived shortcomings. For example, a trainer who is perceived as\nreserved may make an effort to be at class early to welcome and greet each member.\nNewer trainers especially may be shy or nervous in front of a group, and this may blunt their presence and attitude\nSmall mechanical changes, such as eye contact, open body language, and smiling, can go a long way toward putting\nthe trainer\u2019s best foot forward. Trainers might try asking clients simple questions about well-being and then really\nlistening and following up about their answers. These are basic interpersonal skills trainers can initially rely on unti\nthey become more comfortable and engaged with their clients.\ndeMonsTraTion\nThe ability to provide athletes with an accurate visual example of the movement at hand. A trainer may do this using\nhimself or herself as an example or by choosing another athlete to provide the example. This requires a strong aware-\nness of one\u2019s own movement mechanics. It also includes the concept of leading by example; a trainer should follow his\nor her own advice and be an inspiration to clients.\nProvide a visual aid\nDemonstration is a powerful visual tool to aid a trainer\u2019s instruction.

This requires a trainer to adjust demonstrations depend-\ning on the group and its needs. Just like teaching, demonstration may have to be made more simple and obvious\nthan realistic and subtle to meet the needs of the trainees. In cases in which a trainer\u2019s mechanics are limited, using\nothers for demonstration is perfectly acceptable. Trainers who have the capacity to discern good movement patterns\nquickly do not have a problem finding an effective substitute.\nDemonstrate credibility\nDemonstration also covers whether a trainer demonstrates to others that he or she ascribes to the program that is\nrecommended and holds himself or herself to the same standards and values expected of clients. Demonstration\nmore broadly speaks to the trainer\u2019s credibility. Leading by example has a large influence on the culture created at\nthe trainer\u2019s gym. A trainer can ask: How do I get my clients to care about technique? To push themselves harder? To\nadhere to workout standards? To treat each other with respect? Many answers can be provided by examining a train-\ner\u2019s own attitude and actions. The trainer needs to work on improved technique, use high intensity, follow the same\nprogram, follow the range-of-motion standards, count repetitions correctly, support and encourage others, etc.\nThis means a trainer can utilize his or her own firsthand experiences with diet strategies, workout programs, com-\npetition scenarios, etc. to address clients\u2019 questions and help them reach their goals. Insight and advice are best\ndelivered when they are the result of experience. By using firsthand experience, the trainer also serves as a source\nof motivation for others.\nA trainer is in a position of leadership, and leading by example has a trickle-down effect to every part of a community\nThe trainer becomes the model or standard all members wish to emulate.\nConCLusion\nTeaching, seeing, correcting, group management, presence and attitude, and demonstration are the six areas\ntrainers can use to evaluate and develop themselves or the trainers who work for them. An effective trainer must\nhave capacity in each area, and a trainer\u2019s effectiveness is limited by capacity in each. A professional trainer contin-\nues to develop capacity in each area across his or her entire career. This is chasing virtuosity in coaching. \u201cDoing the\ncommon uncommonly well\u201d does not only apply to movement; it can apply to any particular skill.

{"26": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nCOMMON MOVEMENT THEMES FOR FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS\ninTroduCTion\nThere are common movement themes displayed in all foundational movements, from the nine foundational move-\nments in the Level 1 Course to others such as the snatch, kipping pull-up, and handstand push-up. These movement\nthemes broadly categorize similar positions and movement patterns, whether the athlete is static (starting, receiving\nor finishing positions) or dynamic (moving between static positions).\nThese themes are:\n\u2022 midline stabilization,\n\u2022 core-to-extremity movement,\n\u2022 balance about the frontal plane,\n\u2022 posterior-chain engagement,\n\u2022 sound hip function,\n\u2022 active shoulders,\n\u2022 full range of motion about a joint, and\n\u2022 effective stance and/or grip.\nUnderstanding these themes and the contexts in which to apply them will give trainers the general principles for eval-\nuating movement. There are positions or movement patterns that do not fit neatly into these categories, as well as\nmovements that do not demonstrate all the themes. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. It is simply a classification\ntool that can be used to aid development of one\u2019s coaching skill set.\nThese themes are exemplified when an athlete performs a movement correctly (i.e., adhering to the points of per-\nformance). The movement themes increase the potential for improved performance and minimize the risk of injury\nSound mechanics aid performance and risk management by using positions with the best mechanical and muscular\nalignment, conferring safety, efficacy, and efficiency simultaneously.\nMidLine sTabiLiZaTion\nA \u201cmidline\u201d is a plane of bilateral symmetry, but it is used in CrossFit to specifically refer to the relationship of the\nspine (base of the head to the top of the hips) and pelvis during functional movement. The midline trisects the spine\nand bisects the pelvis when the two are in their neutral anatomical relationship. Stabilization means something has\nbeen made stable, or \u201cstatic.\u201d Midline stabilization refers to the athlete\u2019s capacity to prevent movement from this\nneutral spinal position and is synonymous with core strength. Midline stabilization determines whether the athlete\ncan maintain the natural S-curve of the spine to the pelvis when dynamic and/or loaded. Some lifting applications\nrely on a midline posture with some extension past neutral in both the lumbar and thoracic regions. Regardless, this\nposture is maintained throughout the movement.\nStabilization of the spine is largely accomplished by engaging the abdominals (\u201cabs\u201d), internal and external oblique\nmuscles (\u201cobliques\u201d), and erector spinae (\u201cspinal erectors\u201d or simply \u201cerectors\u201d). Engaging the abs helps engage the\nspinal erectors and obliques; together, they create a belt of musculature around the vertebrae."}
{"27": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nTorso as a rigid, integrated structure\nThis neutral, static position maximizes performance because moving the torso as one rigid, integrated structure\nenables the transmission of force between the appendages and the object being lifted. In a push jerk, for example\nthe legs and hips extend force upward into the weight through the torso. A soft midline does not allow for the optima\ntransfer of force to the bar.\nWhen maintaining a neutral spine, the orientation of the vertebrae results in favorable distribution of forces and\nreduces the risk for injury. Where possible, it is ideal to have the midline in a vertical orientation because of the optima\nmuscular and skeletal alignment for force distribution (e.g., in a squat). As the torso moves from a vertical orientation\nas in the deadlift, the demand on the musculature to maintain a neutral spine increases. Forward movement of the\ntorso, however, does not increase the risk of injury if midline stabilization is present. It is when midline stabilization\nis lost that the shear force experienced by the spine increases. The human spine is more susceptible to injury when\nexposed to shear (vs. compression) forces. The resulting shear force attempts to push one vertebra past another\nwhile muscles and ligaments resist this loss of positioning. If the muscles and ligaments are not strong enough, an\ninjury to the spine may occur.\nDeviations from neutral\nDeviations from neutral may occur in flexion (bending forward from neutral) or extension (bending backward from\nneutral). Recall that a natural function of the abdominals is to flex the spine, so spinal flexion by itself is not nec-\nessarily problematic (e.g., getting out of bed) and is potentially beneficial to reduce the lever arm (e.g., gymnastics\nholds). Similarly, the erectors extend the spine. Extending past neutral is not inherently dangerous but can become\nso depending on degree of deviation and the load on the body.\nThe following hierarchy of spinal positioning is listed in order of increasing risk for injury:\n\u2022 Safest: Midline stabilization in a neutral position.\n\u2022 More risky: A non-neutral spine in a static position. Although less ideal than midline stabilization in\na neutral position, static positions (flexed or extended) prevent movement of the individual spinal\nsegments. This means no individual vertebra bears the majority of the lifting force.\n\u2022 Most risky: Loss of a neutral spine during movement, specifically when starting from neutral and moving\nto significant spinal flexion. This is potentially the most injurious, as there is movement of the individual\nspinal segments and one or a few vertebra(e) bear the majority of the lifting force.\nThe most common injury from a loss of midline stabilization occurs when the lumbar spine (L1\u2013L5) flexes under\nload, changing the normal concave curvature of the lower back to convex. Typically, flexion of the spine is seen with\nincreased hip flexion or when the midline is resisting a load on the front side of the body, as in a deadlift.\nAthletes may also deviate from neutral by overextending or hyperextending the spine, which means significantly\nbending backward from neutral into an injurious range of motion. There is a difference between the natural S-curva-\nture of the spine and an exaggerated extension of the spine. Placing athletes in an overextended position does not\nincrease the benefits of a neutral spine and may place them at risk for injury.\nHyperextension can result in the same injuries as excessive flexion (i.e., disc herniation or damage to facet joints)\nHyperextension generally occurs with more flexible athletes or occasionally with more advanced athletes. Over-"}
{"28": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nextension or hyperextension often points to a lack of engagement of the abdominals and can generally be addressed\nby cueing an athlete to tighten the abs. It is most often seen when an athlete lifts overhead.\nCORE-TO-EXTREMITY MOVEMENT\nCore-to-extremity movements demonstrate a sequence of muscular contraction that begins with the large force-pro-\nducing, low-velocity muscles of the core (abdominals and spinal erectors) and hips, and ends with the small force-pro-\nducing, high-velocity muscles of the extremities (e.g., biceps, calves, wrist flexors). Core-to-extremity movement\nbegins with establishing midline stabilization for effective force transfer\u2014i.e., a base is created and force radiates\nfrom there. This muscular patterning teaches the athlete to fluidly transmit power from one area of the body to\nanother. Core-to-extremity movement maximizes performance because it tasks the largest musculature to generate\nforce first, allowing the greatest forces to develop. This sequence improves efficiency and allows the greatest amount\nof work to be accomplished.\nCore-to-extremity movements are less risky than movements that violate this pattern because the largest muscles\nare tasked with generating the most force. Smaller muscle groups and associated tendons and ligaments are more\nsusceptible to injury, such as tearing, when exposed to loading designed for larger movers.\nCore-to-extremity movements are found everywhere, not just with movements that involve the arms and legs, so\nfaults can show up everywhere. Even a shoulder press or a deadlift may not effectively demonstrate core-to-extrem-\nity movement absent a stable midline. For dynamic faults, core-to-extremity violations occur when there is incorrect\ntiming and the arms move before the hips and legs have extended (i.e., pulling or pushing early).\nBALANCE ABOUT THE FRONTAL PLANE\nThe frontal plane divides the athlete into anterior and posterior halves. It is the plane about which one is balanced\nand it bisects the athlete at mid-foot. Referencing the athlete\u2019s movement (i.e., his or her line of action) and the object\nhe or she is moving relative to the frontal plane can often determine the athlete\u2019s efficiency.\nSignificant deviations of the athlete and/or object forward of the frontal plane prevent successful task completion\nespecially as the loading increases. These deviations can also impair other points of performance (i.e., neutral spine\nweight on the heels). Generally, moving an object along straight lines (i.e., in the frontal plane) can increase perfor-\nmance by increasing efficiency as the object follows the shortest distance between two points. Note, however, the\nathlete\u2019s movement accommodates the object and may or may not be characterized by straight lines. For example\nin a movement such as the squat, an effective line of action is created when the hips sit back and down as the knees\nbend. In this manner, the athlete is best able to keep the weight on the heels, and when the squat is loaded, the bar\ntravels along the shortest line. This movement also can reduce excessive force at the patella, which may occur if the\nknees translate excessively forward (i.e., such that the heels come up).\nBalance about the frontal plane can also be referenced in a kipping pull-up, where the plane is formed along the\nline from the hands to the floor. The athlete is most efficient when the center of mass oscillates about this plane to\nmaintain the most efficient timing of the swing. In the kipping pull-up, when the center of mass deviates from the\nfrontal plane too much, the athlete loses timing and has to reset the swing.\nA lack of balance about the frontal plane may increase the risk for injury because of increased potential for other\nmovement errors. For example, if the chest drops in a front squat with the bar deviating forward of the fronta"}

However, a violation of balance about the frontal plane by itself is not\nterribly risky.\nPOSTERIOR-CHAIN ENGAGEMENT\nThe posterior chain includes the group of muscles, tendons, and ligaments on the posterior (back) of the body, which\ncontains the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), gluteal muscles (\u201cglutes\u201d), and spina\nerectors. \u201cEngagement\u201d means this musculature contributes to the movement. Posterior-chain engagement does not\nrefer to using the posterior chain in an attempt to exclude the anterior chain. Ideally, there is a balance of pressure\nbetween the balls of the feet and the heels, with the line of action at the frontal plane. Posterior-chain engagement\nalso enables the athlete to maintain optimal knee alignment with the foot.\nInclusion of this large set of musculature on the backside of the body maximizes performance because of the\nincreased power generation, thereby resulting in faster speed to completion or increased load lifted. Keeping the\nheels rooted brings the load closer to the frontal plane, which helps the athlete stay balanced and drive the load up\nnot forward. This increases efficiency. Engagement of the spinal erectors is also essential for maintaining midline\nstabilization and providing the strongest base to transmit forces.\nFinally, engagement of the posterior chain helps keep the knees in line with the toes, where there is the best mechan-\nical position of leverage between the upper and lower leg. With posterior-chain engagement, greater musculature is\nrecruited to move the load, and enough room is created for full range of motion in a squatting movement. When the\nknees collapse inward, the center of pressure shifts forward (given the angle at which the knees flex). This positioning\nis often a result of underdeveloped external rotators of the hip.\nPosterior-chain engagement contributes to safety because it promotes midline stabilization and balance about the\nfrontal plane. Also, keeping the knees in line with the toes reduces lateral and rotational forces at the knee joint\nThese forces are problematic for a hinge joint such as the knee, where associated tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and\nmenisci could be damaged when poor mechanics are allowed to go unchanged over long periods of time. It is less\nlikely that a single repetition causes significant damage to the joints, but thousands of repetitions performed over\ntime can wear on the knees\u2019 structural integrity.\nPressure in the feet\nA lack of posterior-chain engagement results in the athlete (and/or object) shifting excessively forward of the fronta\nplane. A trainer can see this by observing the center of pressure in the feet in all movements, especially with any knee\nor hip flexion. This may or may not occur in conjunction with the heel coming off the floor. The heel can remain on the\nground while the center of pressure shifts forward.\nThis may also indicate premature shifting of weight to the toes, especially during an explosive hip extension, which\nresults in the hip extending forward rather than upward. If an athlete jumps forward during a lift, it may be an indica-\ntion of a premature shift of weight to the toes. \u201cTriple extension\u201d is not a forced calf raise in conjunction with exten-\nsion of the knees and hips; it is achieved when the heels leave the ground because of, and after, a violent extension\nthereby creating extension of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Analysis of elite lifters shows that the longer a lifter\nremains in contact with the ground during the second pull, the greater the acceleration on the bar. Greater surface\narea in contact with the ground enables a greater force to be transferred."}
{"30": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nKnee position\nWith regard to knee position, although there are two directions the knees can travel to come out of alignment with\nthe feet (laterally or medially), the fault is usually seen when the knees collapse inward (medially). The degree of devi-\nation in knee alignment generally increases with increased hip and knee flexion in a movement and/or wider stances\nAn athlete with a poor knee position in any movement often produces the error to some degree any time the knee\nflexes. For example, an athlete whose knees collapse in a squat is likely to have the knees collapse to a less obvious\ndegree in running, box jumps, push presses, etc.\nSOUND HIP FUNCTION\nSound hip function refers to the athlete\u2019s ability to flex and extend the hip to maximize its contribution to a move-\nment. The hamstrings and glutes are powerful hip extensors. Powerful and complete hip extension is necessary for\nelite athletic capacity because:\n1. it applies the most force on the object, and\n2. it creates the most elevation on the object, giving the athlete the most time to accommodate or receive it.\nThere are no major safety issues with slow or incomplete hip extension.\nPoor hip function is usually expressed in one of three ways:\n1. muted hip,\n2. lack of hip extension, and/or\n3. slow hip extension.\nA muted hip never closes/flexes (and therefore is a \u201cpermanently\u201d open hip). If the hip never closes, the movement is\npredominantly driven by the quadriceps. The quadriceps extend the knee without contribution from the hamstrings\nand glutes. Lack of hip extension does not allow the power of the hamstrings and glutes to be fully expressed. This\ndoes not effectively put acceleration on the bar or object and therefore does not elevate it to any significant degree\nEven small deviations from full hip extension result in reduced power transmission. The speed of hip extension\nplays a critical role in accelerating the object being lifted, particularly when the object must be elevated far beyond\nits starting point (e.g., from rack to overhead). In all cases, the power of the musculature of the hips is not opti-\nmally expressed.\nACTIVE SHOULDERS\nAn active shoulder provides the most stable position for the shoulder when working against a load. This means an\nactive shoulder is present in the overhead lifts as well as the deadlift series, including the deadlift, sumo deadlift high\npull, and medicine-ball clean. Outside the nine foundational movements, active shoulders are found in the kipping\npull-up, ring dip, handstand push-up, row, and snatch, among other movements.\nActive shoulders are about scapular position and stabilization and require different actions by the athlete, depend-\ning on the movement. In each movement, the athlete attempts to keep the shoulder in a relatively neutral, natura\nposition, without yielding to a load. At the same time, he or she will create enough space between the anatomica\nstructures of the shoulder so they may pass freely without impingement. Typically, this means an athlete demon-\nstrates an active shoulder by applying force in the direction opposite the load. For example, in an overhead squat, the\nathlete pushes up on the barbell. In a push-up, the athlete pushes down into the ground. In a row, the athlete pulls"}
{"31": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nback to prevent the rounding of the shoulders. There are also cases in which an active shoulder is not achieved by\npushing into the load (e.g., bench press). In all cases, the retraction, elevation, etc. is not taken to the end range that\nresults in a contrived position. For example, retraction in a deadlift is not full retraction that may result in a loss of\nmidline stabilization or a position that would not be possible under any real load.\nAn active shoulder creates optimal skeletal alignment, which enables the most musculature of the torso (e.g., tra-\npezius) to aid in the stability of the shoulder and potentiate the greatest force. An active shoulder also moves the\nacromion process out of the way of the humerus, reducing the chance for impingement of the biceps tendons and\nrotator-cuff muscles. The chances for impingement increase as the grip narrows. In an overhead squat, for example\na wider grip requires less elevation to create clearance space.\nWhen an athlete loses an active shoulder, the direction the shoulders move (e.g., forward, down) depends on the\nmovement. The coach needs to observe from where the force is being applied and determine if the shoulders are\nmoving in that same direction (e.g., yielding).\nfuLL range of MoTion abouT a JoinT\nFull range of motion about a joint describes the natural anatomical beginning and end positions of a movement. Ful\nrange of motion allows a greater complement of musculature to be used (e.g., reaching full depth in a squat, using\nactive shoulders) and in some cases better mechanical advantage (e.g., bar resting on the body in the front rack)\nJoint safety is maximized by preserving the range of motion required by life while best distributing forces at any one\njoint or throughout a series of joints. Additionally, increasing the musculature and joints involved allows the athlete\nto develop the neuromuscular coordination that is universally found in compound movements and sport.\nToward the other extreme, hyperextension or artificially trying to create more range of motion past a joint\u2019s natura\nanatomical function can be detrimental to joint health; more is not always better.\nTraining to the full range of motion in functional movements best prepares an individual for any conceivable task\nWhile life\u2019s tasks may not always require full range of motion, training to the limits of one\u2019s natural end range prevents\ndeficiencies if and when the joints need to move the full range. Using full range of motion preserves joint health, flex-\nibility, and strength, reducing the chance of injury and decrepitude later in life. If there is not a more pressing safety\nissue that needs to be fixed first, a trainer needs to preserve full range of motion above much else (e.g., adding load\nincreasing speed).\neffeCTive sTanCe and/or griP\nThis refers to the foot and hand positions adopted during a movement, where the optimal stance and grip promote\ntask accomplishment and the ability to display all the movement\u2019s points of performance.\nThere are two common stances in CrossFit. A narrower stance (hip width) is used in the deadlifts, presses, and the\nOlympic lifts. The hip-width stance promotes a more direct transfer of force through the heels/floor and into the\nobject being moved. A wider stance (shoulder width) is used in squatting movements, allowing for greater depth\nand contribution of the posterior chain. Some force-transfer efficiency may be lost with the wider stance (relative to\nhip width), but function and range of motion are gained. It is possible to take a different stance to allow for different\nloading mechanics. For example, a wider stance is adopted in the sumo deadlift. This allows the torso to remain more\nupright, allowing the legs and hips to more readily assist the back during the lift."}
{"32": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nThe grip is usually outside the shoulders or hips so as not to interfere with the object or other points of performance\nbut it may also be wider if the demands of the movement require it. For example, the grip in the deadlift should\nbe wide enough so as not to interfere with the legs, but it is significantly wider in the snatch to reduce the overal\ndistance the bar must travel.\nIn many real-life applications with odd objects, a wider stance or narrower grip may be used. It is critical for athletes\nto learn how to apply the other points of performance, regardless of the stance and grip used to accommodate an\nobject. This is especially true of preparing an athlete for situations outside the gym, when a more convenient stance\nand grip are not always possible.\nThere are no major safety concerns from a lack of effective stance or grip except when other points of performance\nare adversely affected. The value of any stance and grip adjustment should be assessed based upon its effect on al\nthe other points of performance in the movement.\nASSESSING SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE\nSimply observing an athlete\u2019s position in a movement does not provide enough of a context to assess safety risk and\nperformance benefit. Both are assessed in light of the individual\u2019s:\n1. athletic capacity,\n2. loading,\n3. positioning, and\n4. speed of execution.\nA trainer cannot identify bad positions without this greater context. Decreased performance and increased injury are\nmore likely as the athlete moves further from a sound position or as loads increase relative to the athlete\u2019s maximum\nFor example, picking up a grocery bag with a rounded back is a common occurrence and contains little safety risk\nfor many CrossFit athletes. Nevertheless, this same positioning could be more problematic for a beginner deadlifting\n135 lb. or an advanced competitive athlete deadlifting 500 lb.\nIn daily training, athletes are encouraged to exercise using the correct positions to develop strength and awareness\nUsing sound mechanics promotes greater potential for power development and decreases injury risk in the long\nterm. Training in the best positions, regardless of the load present, develops a sound default motor pattern that\nbetter prepares athletes for loaded and high-intensity scenarios.\nBecause of the benefits to safety, efficacy, and efficiency, proper mechanics are a daily focus of CrossFit trainers\nWorking toward better movement is not only for beginners and is arguably more important as the athlete advances\nThe margin for error decreases as load and speed increase. Top competitors rely on efficiencies that can create\nseconds of gain. A trainer cannot settle for anything less than excellent mechanics. For example, an immature squat\nmay be a safe position, but if the athlete can learn to lift the chest, every degree of elevation can increase the loads\nthat can be lifted in a clean or snatch, for example. A trainer must challenge himself or herself to develop better\nathletes beyond their current capacity."}
{"33": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nConCLusion\nThese themes provide a template from which a trainer can evaluate all movement in order to maximize both safety\nand performance for his or her athletes. The ability to recognize and correct violations is essential for a trainer\nregardless of whether the athlete\u2019s violation is major or minor.\nUnderstanding these themes provides a template for evaluating other approaches to coaching a movement. These\nthemes also can help a coach think critically about any methods before including them in instruction: If there is not\na clearly demonstrable mechanism that creates a safer or more effective movement, it is usually an unnecessary\ndistraction.\nFor example, suppose a coach considers a new starting posture for the snatch or clean. He or she wants to use a\ndynamic start such that the athlete moves through the setup without a pause before the first pull. If the athlete\nis able to achieve the common themes (e.g., midline stabilization, posterior-chain engagement, balance about the\nfrontal plane) in a static start and there is no clear performance gain from a dynamic start (i.e., increased loads lifted)\nit becomes an unnecessary layer of complexity to add to the mechanics of the lift. Changes in movement mechanics\nshould be made when there are obvious gains in performance or a decreased risk for injury."}

{"36": "Heavy Days, continued\nHEAVY DAYS\nThere is the tendency for new CrossFit athletes and trainers to avoid heavy days entirely or execute them incorrectly.\nHowever, CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program. While people sometimes characterize CrossFit by its pro-\ngramming of mixed-modal workouts for time (\u201cmet-cons\u201d), this is a limited view. Days devoted to strength training\nare essential to CrossFit and are integral to CrossFit\u2019s prescription of constantly varied workouts.\nHeavy days are necessary to build top-end strength and power. Power output decreases with time, meaning that an\nathlete\u2019s work capacity in very short time domains sets the theoretical limit for his or her entire curve (Figure 1). It is\npossible to have high levels of short-duration power and little power elsewhere (e.g., a powerlifter), but it is impossi-\nble to have low levels of short-duration power and higher levels of longer-duration power. Therefore, heavy days are\nessential to a general physical preparedness program and should be used at least once a week or once every two\ncycles (where a cycle is three on, one off).\nfigure 1. Generalized work-capacity curve.\nHeavy days are not the only time athletes drive strength adaptations. Even within a metabolic-conditioning workout,\ndepending on the task and the capacity of the athlete, any number of exercises may build strength. Push-ups for\nnovices build pressing strength similar to a bench press, and attempting a 95-lb. thruster for a new CrossFit athlete\nbuilds squatting strength. As an athlete\u2019s strength increases, push-ups and 95-lb. thrusters tend to favor other adap-\ntations such as stamina, and greater loads are necessary to further increase top-end power.\nHeavy days can be completed with most any weightlifting or gymnastics movement, such as weighted dips and\npull-ups and lifting odd objects (e.g., sandbags, axles). More often than not, however, a barbell is best because it is\nimpossible to match the barbell\u2019s ease and range of loading with other equipment. Heavy days may also include all\nvariations of standard barbell movements (e.g., hang, power, from a deficit, pulling from pins/bumpers)."}
{"37": "Heavy Days, continued\nRepetition schemes\nThe heavy-day workout consists of small sets, most often in the range of 1 to 5 repetitions, where the total volume of\nworking repetitions is approximately 7 to 25. Repetitions significantly outside this range do not produce the desired\nresponse. If there are too few repetitions (e.g., one repetition of a near-maximum load), the athlete does not produce\nenough stress on the taxed muscles to drive a new adaptation. Conversely, too many repetitions (e.g., 30 or more\nrepetitions of near-maximum load) produces too much stress for the athlete to recover from in a reasonable time\nperiod. The working sets generally occur at or above 80\u201385 percent of a 1-repetition-maximum load, and warm-up\nsets used to get to this loading do not count toward the total working repetitions. This is not an exact percentage\nbut a working set should be heavy enough to require concentrated effort. The working sets also do not produce a\nsignificant cardiorespiratory response.\nRepetition schemes may vary. As a general guideline, the higher the repetitions in a set or across the entire session\nthe lower the loading. This tends to better develop muscular stamina and/or technique. The lower the repetitions\nthe higher the loading. This tends to better develop top-end strength. Both approaches should be used. Repetition\npatterns include standard schemes such as 7 x 1, 5 x 3, 5 x 5 (sets x reps); pyramid-like patterns of 1-2-3-2-1 (reps\nper set); descending/ascending schemes such as 5-4-3-2-1 (reps per set); no set specificity (e.g., work up to a max\npush press); and on-the-minute training (1, 2, or 3 repetitions on the minute, every minute for 10 minutes), among\nothers. Failed attempts count toward working sets. However, the goal of a session should be to complete the majority\nof the lifts.\nHeavy days are for everyone: the young, old, fit, and unfit. Using the concept of relative intensity, a trainer has each\nathlete lift a load that is relatively heavy for him or her. Even beginners should participate, although a trainer should\nbe more cautious progressing a new athlete in load. Trainers can potentially give beginners more repetitions (either\nwithin each set or by increasing the total number of sets) to very gradually progress to a reasonably challenging\nworking weight while instilling appropriate mechanics. Relatively new athletes often set a personal record every time\nthey lift heavy. As the lifter becomes more experienced, sessions without a new personal record may occur. Setting\na personal record is not necessary to reap the benefits of lifting heavy.\nMinimizing risk\nAs risk increases with load, the trainer has several safety concerns to manage when leading a strength session. A\nheavy-day class best begins with a thorough warm-up to prepare the athletes for maximal loading (e.g., increase\ncore temperature and improve range of motion). It also provides the trainer with an opportunity to correct and\nrefine mechanics across warm-up sets of the movement to minimize risk. Finding the best way to complete warm-up\nsets usually becomes an intuitive process as athletes become more experienced with lifting heavy. However, most\nathletes in their first few years still need direction through this section. Common practice for warm-up sets is at\nleast 3 to 5 warm-up sets, where the sets start with a lighter weight/higher repetition count and progress to heavier\nweight/lower repetition count. The rest periods in the warm-up sets do not need to be as long as during the working\nsets. Whatever the warm-up is, trainers cannot fatigue the athlete for the work sets. Instead, warm-up sets gradually\nprime the body for heavier loading while refining the mechanics of the lift.\nThe trainer must also teach each athlete how to bail and/or spot as necessary before any significant weight is\nattempted. It is easiest to have participants practice this with a PVC or dowel. A trainer cannot assume athletes\nwill perform bailing or spotting techniques correctly without specific instructions. The gym floor also needs to be"}
{"38": "Heavy Days, continued\narranged to ensure safe, walkable distance between working athletes, and the floor should be absent of extra equip-\nment. Trainers may choose to have participants share racks, in part to reduce equipment and space needs. Sharing\nracks also allows athletes to help one another with loading, unloading, and spotting. It also allows for adequate\nrest time between sets so athletes fully recover. When using racks, additional instructions are needed to ensure\nthat athletes keep enough distance between themselves and the racks when lifting. The trainer needs to clearly\ndescribe how the working sets should be approached to avoid confusion. For example, the workout may be 5 x 5\nfront squats. Does the trainer want the athletes to try to increase the load with every set? Does the trainer want the\nathletes to hold a certain percentage across all sets? Or does the trainer perhaps want the athletes to find a new\n5-repetition maximum, meaning the exact number of working sets is less important (maybe it takes 4 sets, maybe\n5 sets)? All these approaches have validity and potential benefits, but the trainer needs to indicate what the intent is\non a particular day.\nDuring the working sets, the trainer must appropriately apply the principles of threshold training just as he or she\nwould in any other workout. Once an athlete\u2019s mechanics significantly deviate from the points of performance, the\nload needs to be reduced. This is especially true when multiple verbal and visual cues do not result in any improve-\nment in mechanics. It is possible that the trainer can fix the mechanics at lighter loads and then allow the athlete to\nagain increase the load gradually. Deviations from points of performance may also require the trainer to change the\nmovement for a few repetitions before using the entire movement (e.g., using snatch pulls to correct an athlete who\nis pulling early in the full snatch). Once the workout is complete, the trainer should include equipment clean-up and\nworkout logging as part of the cool-down period.\nCueing during a heavy lifting session needs to be very direct. The athlete\u2019s attention will be almost solely focused\non the effort required to complete the lift. The trainer will have little time or opportunity to impact the quality of the\nmovement during the set. Therefore, cues need to be short, easy to implement, and delivered with an intensity that\nmatches the effort of the lift. If more technical consideration is needed, the time between sets can be a great oppor-\ntunity to elaborate. However, upon returning to the next set, the athlete should have a very clear picture of what he or\nshe needs to focus on. Giving your athlete more than one or two things to think about often results in no change at all\nConCLusion\nTrainers need to regularly program strength days with their clients and ensure all participants achieve the desired\nstimulus during the training session. These sessions provide coaches and athletes with opportunities to improve\nmechanics, acquire new skills, and see progress in a modality that is vital to developing the fitness CrossFit seeks."}

{"44": "Nutrition, continued\nNUTRITION\ninTroduCTion\nHow and what you eat are behaviors that can have a dramatic impact on health and performance. During the Level 1\nnutrition lecture, participants were walked through the importance of eating quality foods, and there was discussion\nof a few common ways to quantify food intake. Eating meats, vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and\nno sugar in combination with weighing and measuring macronutrient quantities can have a profound effect on one\u2019s\nhealth and performance outcomes.\nA tsunami of chronic disease has been sweeping across the world, and CrossFit affiliates are the lifeboats. Each gym\nhas within its walls the necessary ingredients to make profound changes to one\u2019s health.\nAs a coach, knowing what to eat, how to eat, and why it is important is only half the battle. The real struggle is in\nimplementing dietary changes and trying to create a high level of compliance.\nPerhaps one of the most important aspects of behavior change is one\u2019s belief that he or she is capable of making a\nspecific change. This is considered one\u2019s self-efficacy.\nIt is very important for coaches to know they have everything they need in the gym to increase an athlete\u2019s self-effi-\ncacy. Coaches should feel equipped to set up the perfect intervention to get athletes eating better for long periods\nof time, if not indefinitely.\nIt is up to the coach to help increase athletes\u2019 self-efficacy and encourage them to believe that changes are possible.\nIncreases in self-efficacy are a result of:\n\u2022 Mastery experiences: These are small achievable steps throughout the process. Success in these steps will\nincrease self-belief (i.e., adding vegetables to each meal).\n\u2022 A coach\u2019s ability to adjust to different emotional and physiological states: A coach must adjust to how others\nperceive change and deal with stress (i.e., be sensitive to the fact that Rebecca has always eaten this way,\nand she has three young children to consider).\n\u2022 Vicarious experiences: Coaches should use the successes of others to convince athletes that they, too, can\nbe successful (i.e., Joe started by cutting out low-quality food for a month. Then he would quantify only his\nbreakfast. Eventually, he measured his lunch, and six months later, he has lost 40 lb.).\n\u2022 Verbal/social persuasion: Athletes should receive verbal support from others, including from role models\n(the trainer) and/or in small groups (i.e., create an accountability buddy, send reminders, videos, articles\ncontaining any material that motivates the individual to stay the course).\nThese are four factors that affect self-efficacy (Bandura). These factors should be sought in combination with each\nother for best results.\nWhen thinking about behavior change within the context of a gym environment, we can understand the stages of\nchange as contemplation, action, and maintenance. These three stages apply most accurately to the gym environ-\nment and the relationship between coach and athlete."}
{"45": "Nutrition, continued\nContemplation: The athlete has a desire to make a change and recognizes that his or her behavior may be problematic\nAction: The behavior change has been initiated and healthier behaviors are being acquired.\nMaintenance: There is sustained healthy behavior and the athlete has developed the skills to deal with relapse.\nA key component to successfully changing behavior and progressing through each stage is self-efficacy. Does the\nathlete believe in his or her ability to change eating habits and to eat the optimal ratios and amounts?\nConTeMPLaTion\nA coach must first educate. Teaching the art of nutrition is no different than teaching functional movements. It stil\nrequires an in-depth knowledge of the material:\n\u2022 What are quality foods? What are unhealthy foods? How do you replace the unhealthy foods with healthier\nchoices?\n\u2022 How do you quantify macronutrients, and what tools are needed to weigh and measure?\n\u2022 Why is changing your diet important, and what are the expected outcomes?\n\u2022 What skills do you need to make this change and maintain it?\nCoaches then need to find the best way to communicate this information to their athletes. The explanation must be\nsimple, actionable, and realistic. This starts the process of building the skill set and producing the incentives required\nto make meaningful changes to diet.\nSuccessful gyms have accomplished this in a number of ways.\n\u2022 Small Nutrition Talks\n{ These talks are often provided during introductory sessions.\n{ Each small talk builds on the one prior. Athletes continue to develop knowledge and enhance skills\nin small steps (mastery experiences).\n{ Typically, food logs are used to determine necessary changes.

The assumption\nthat building a shopping list is easy is one of the reasons many do not succeed. The coach\nmust guide this process.\n\u2022 Large Nutrition Lectures\n{ Typically, these are lectures that cover everything from eating quality foods to using different ways\nto weigh and measure food.\n{ The information is provided all at once to a large group of athletes, typically with a question and\nanswer session at the end.\n{ These tend to be used as an introduction to nutrition challenges.\n\u0083 The main points might be covered again in a small group format during the challenge.\nIt is important to understand that how someone perceives the journey will also have a profound impact on the results\nPerception is reality.

Some are very confident in their abilities.\nMaybe they have some past experience with being a high-level athlete, or they are very successful in other\nareas of their life. These experiences can be used as a way to sustain efforts necessary for optimal results.\n\u2022 That being said, the majority of the people who are trying to progress from sickness to wellness will have\nsome level of self-doubt, fear, or anxiety.\nA good coach is sensitive to the state of the athlete and finds ways to relieve stress and make the experience positive\nThis becomes very important in group nutrition challenges. Remember, half the battle is instilling belief in the athletes\nthat they can do it. Consider the following:\n\u2022 Being part of a group can be extremely intimidating, especially if you are the least fit.\n\u2022 Successful coaches key into this right away and find a mentor to work closely with this type of athlete.\nMentors should be positive, relatable, and reliable.\n\u2022 Sometimes, the coach becomes the mentor and makes himself or herself available for extra guidance and\nmotivation.\naCTion\nOnce the athlete is ready to start, the coach needs to find ways to initiate change and keep it going. It is easy to\ncomplete a nutrition challenge and then fall back into old habits, eating the same way as before.\nVicarious experiences\nOne way a trainer can keep this behavior going is to provide vicarious experiences.\n\u2022 Find members that have had long-term success and use their stories.

{"51": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nPROGRAM DESIGN AND SCALING\nCrossFit is defined as \u201cconstantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity,\u201d with the goal to develop\nfitness that prepares one optimally for any task imaginable. The programming material of the Level 1 Course outlines\nworkout variables and basic considerations for structuring workouts. The programming material at this course builds\non that foundation by focusing on long-term program design for individuals and groups.\nAmong the myriad variables to control when programming workouts, a trainer cannot lose sight of the small influ-\nence programming has among a host of other factors that determine a client\u2019s success. Programming, whether\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d is secondary to effective coaching, appropriate scaling, using sound mechanics, and developing a\ngroup dynamic conducive to pushing oneself (i.e., highest intensity brought to the work). Even with less-than-optimal\nprogramming, a trainer who has a good eye for movement mechanics and develops a good rapport with his or her\nclients will help people improve their fitness for years. Functional movements performed at high intensity, regard-\nless of how well they are combined and varied, are powerful enough to elicit dramatic changes in one\u2019s health and\nperformance, particularly for the unaccustomed. Therefore, trainers can spend more time focusing on their skill set\nand member rapport rather than striving beyond reason to create the \u201cperfect\u201d template and programming cycles.\nANALYZING PROGRAMMING FOR EFFECTIVENESS\nEffective or \u201cgood\u201d programming produces results, and the relative degree to which programming is effective is the\ndegree to which it optimizes fitness. The standard by which to evaluate any programming is measurable improve-\nment in performance markers. For a CrossFit athlete, results would include increased loads on heavy days, decreased\ntimes on task-priority workouts, and increased repetitions or rounds on time-priority workouts. An optimal program\nwould see the maximum possible increases in any test of fitness.\nOther measurable markers include health markers. Faster Fran times, more rounds of Cindy, and heavier 1-repe-\ntition-maximum clean and jerks are correlated with decreases in blood pressure, triglycerides, and resting heart\nrate. Additional results may be reported by clients, such as improved quality of life, improved confidence, increased\nenergy, and mood alteration. Anecdotal improvements in quality of life are side benefits of CrossFit. While not mea-\nsurable, they are valued by many clients over the metrics of improved workout statistics and health markers.\nIneffective programming does not produce results, or at least not to the same degree possible with effective pro-\ngramming. These suboptimal results could include decreased performance on benchmark workouts, merely modest\nimprovements in performance markers, or even a higher rate of injury, which could be easily avoided by following\nother programming.\nThe key is that program effectiveness is based on results: real changes in measurable, observable, repeatable\nmarkers. Clients need to get results for the programming to be deemed effective.\nTrainers programming for a group or an entire affiliate can simply use the same measurement applied across the\nentire gym population. A trainer can look for long-term trends and patterns in the group by assessing performance\non select benchmarks. For example, a trainer may select specific benchmarks to follow: He or she may track clients\n1-repetition-maximum snatch, 1-repetition-maximum back squat, Grace, Fran, Tabata squats, 1-mile run, JT, Fight\nGone Bad, 5-km row, and Cindy as his or her fitness tests. An evaluation does not have to include these exact"}

As long as\nthe majority of members are improving their scores on these days, the programming is effective. A trainer must\nremember that this is a long-term view, and he or she cannot expect everyone to set a personal record (PR) with every\nbenchmark test due to variables beyond his or her control, such as mood, sleep, stress, the physiology of the athlete\nand even the athlete\u2019s commitment to the program. Intermediate to advanced athletes, for example, cannot expect\nto set personal records every time they repeat a workout due to the decreased magnitude of adaptations that result\nfrom increased proficiency (i.e., the learning curve).\nvarianCe in CrossfiT PrograMMing\n\u201cVariance\u201d refers to the intended variation of functional movements, loads, repetition schemes, and time durations\nwithin a single workout and across a series of workouts in order to best maximize one\u2019s fitness. Other factors (e.g.\nenvironment, gear) can be varied but are not the primary variables to consider. The variation of workout variables\nacross months and years determines how well one is prepared for any conceivable test of fitness. A program with\na narrow focus may show great results in one area but have little impact on another. For example, a powerlifting\nprogram may see increases in strength and power for certain lifts, but it might produce worse performance in lon-\nger-duration, higher-repetition scenarios or even decreased strength and power in certain other lifts, like the snatch\nIn the name of variance, there are few absolutes for formulating the infinite combinations of workout variables. An\nerror in programming variance is only problematic when the error becomes routine. Today\u2019s workout does not have a\ndramatic impact on one\u2019s fitness; it is the series of workouts that result in long-term change. Programming too many\nheavy days in a row, for example, develops a narrow capacity. Conversely, programming a few heavy days back-to-\nback on occasion may be an entirely appropriate or beneficial stimulus.\nLong-term planning and routine assessment\nEffectively combining workout variables over the long term requires intentional and careful planning. The program-\nmer must be well versed in CrossFit methodology to understand similar and disparate stimuli, as well as which\nstimuli are the most potent. Programming requires reviewing what has been completed recently in an attempt to\nprovide new variance. It must also allow for routine assessment to ensure progress is occurring.\nTo a lesser degree, the programmer must understand each athlete\u2019s current capacity and weaknesses. For any\nlevel of athlete, a well-varied program should cover many different aspects of fitness. As an athlete becomes more\nadvanced (e.g., a CrossFit Games competitor), additional time may be needed to improve weaknesses in addition to\nregular CrossFit programming. Regardless, effective programming cannot be random. Although CrossFit program-\nming appears random to some due to its non-linear and non-formulaic pattern, its variety is a result of a planned\nattempt to address all fitness tests. This does not happen by the luck of the draw.\nCrossFit.com programming\nCrossFit.com provides a great expression of variance for general physical preparedness. An athlete who can perform\nall main-site workouts as prescribed (Rx\u2019d) has a robust fitness capacity. Across all the workouts on CrossFit.com\nsome very broad trends suggest some combinations are more useful than others to develop this level of fitness\nCrossFit more frequently programs whole-body, natural, high-power movements in short, intense workouts because\nof their far-reaching effects on one\u2019s overall fitness. These principles are generally expressed in task-priority couplets\nand triplets of 15 minutes or less, which include full-body, high-power movements utilizing complementary functions\n(e.g., pulling vs. pressing). This simple, but highly effective\u2014i.e., elegant\u2014programming drives CrossFit\u2019s potency. A"}
{"53": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nprogrammer cannot be fooled into believing the simplicity of the movements and combinations equates to \u201csimple\u201d\nresults. Complexity does not inherently produce greater efficiency or efficacy, and arguably it detracts from both.\nClassic CrossFit benchmark workouts such as Fran, Helen, Diane, Elizabeth, and Fight Gone Bad are all excellent\nexamples of these basic principles. Fran (21-15-9 repetitions of thrusters and pull-ups) is an elegant combination\ntwo full-body movements, complementary in function (lower-body push and upper-body pull) to allow intensity to\nremain high while simultaneously expressing functions necessitated by life (squatting, putting an object overhead\npulling the body up).\nCrossFit programming is best summarized in World-Class Fitness in 100 Words, by CrossFit Founder Coach Greg\nGlassman: \u201cPractice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C & J (clean and jerk), and snatch. Similarly\nmaster the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips\nsplits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc., hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many\ncombinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly\nlearn and play new sports.\u201d\nAlthough many CrossFit workouts follow these trends, not all should. Less frequently, athletes need to be exposed to\nworkouts that are more unorthodox. For example, there are times when workout variables that result in decreased\npower output are entirely beneficial for an individual. A load that may be too heavy for an athlete to move con-\ntinuously in a workout is also a stimulus for greater strength. A high-repetition scheme that causes the athlete to\nstop multiple times in a single set is a stimulus for greater stamina. Even using lower-powered movements such\nas a Turkish get-up in a workout are useful occasionally for developing greater coordination, balance, and shoulder\nstrength under cardiorespiratory stress. The bulk of workouts, however, should strive for simple, bold pairings.\noPTiMiZing CrossfiT PrograMMing\nMost every client can improve his or her fitness without individualized programming. Small adjustments in the\ncontext of regular CrossFit programming, such as weakness work and scaling workouts appropriately, can accelerate\na client\u2019s results within general group programming.\nWorking weaknesses\nA weakness is a certain skill that is lacking relative to an athlete\u2019s proficiency in other areas. By improving one\u2019s\ncapacity in these weak areas, the athlete\u2019s overall fitness increases. Effective CrossFit programming by itself is aimed\ntoward improving weaknesses. With well-varied, unbiased combinations of loads, time durations, movements\netc., clients inevitably see improvements in their fitness for years. Over the months and years, just performing the\nelements one struggles with will improve one\u2019s proficiency in these movements.\nAn athlete may choose to do additional weakness work to accelerate progress and will likely find this also improves\nstrengths. Working on weaknesses is also important for clients who have reached a plateau. Coach Glassman has\nasserted the following: \u201cThere is more traction, more advantage, more opportunity in pursuing that one thing that\nyou don\u2019t want to see come out (of the hopper) headlong than to put more time into that thing you\u2019re already good\nat. That thing that you don\u2019t want to see come out is a chink in your armor. And addressing it will make a difference\nfor you in ways that you\u2019ll never be able to predict.\u201d"}
{"54": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nIt is unlikely that the programming needs to change drastically to address weaknesses, particularly for an affiliate\nor large group setting. Further, trying to tailor the program to every individual weakness is impossible. The best the\ntrainer can do is to observe and respond to the general trends in the gym and provide well-varied programming\nconsistently.\nConstant assessment is needed to ensure that too much capacity is not lost in the strong areas. When assessment\nhas shown that the weak areas are now at an acceptable level, the trainer should look to identify the next area\nof weakness and make small adjustments accordingly. A radical change in programming is likely to eliminate the\nbenefits experienced elsewhere (e.g., programming becomes too skewed toward the new goal).\nIf the programming becomes too skewed toward working on specific elements, then it is biased. Biasing is program-\nming certain elements more frequently regardless of current capacity in those areas. Biasing does not necessarily\nresult in an increase in fitness; it results in an increase in a specific capacity. Biasing is not necessarily negative if it\nserves the athlete\u2019s preference or goal. It is only a problem when the athlete is seeking general fitness and continues\nto follow a biased program. Addressing weaknesses may eventually become a bias in the absence of assessment.\nWeakness work can be easily included in the warm-up of the class, focusing on the technique of one of the more chal-\nlenging movements. This gives clients extra practice time to improve a deficiency and potentially allows for a more\n\u201cpersonalized\u201d program. During warm-up and skill sessions, which are often heavily biased toward newer and less\nproficient athletes, an effective trainer needs to also offer challenging options for the advanced athletes.\nFor example, suppose a trainer led a warm-up that included a skill session on pistols. Although most of the athletes\nmay be working on getting their first pistol, perhaps using a band or squatting to a box with a support, advanced\nathletes may be working on weighted pistols (e.g., with a bar in the overhead-squat position). There are examples of\nhow to use warm-ups to implement weakness work in the \u201cExample Warm-ups to Address Weaknesses\u201d section of\nthis training guide. With well-varied workouts, much of the warm-up can coincide with movement preparation for the\nworkout to practice elements that are usually weak (e.g., handstand push-ups, muscle-ups, double-unders).\nRegardless of the movements selected, trainers should be sure to avoid pre-fatiguing the client. The goal of the\nwarm-up is not to make it another workout. An example of a poor choice of warm-up may be doing three rounds of\n15 pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, and hip extensions before the workout Cindy (as many repetitions as possible\nin 20 minutes of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats). Pre-fatigue is of particular concern when a trainer plans\na longer skill session before the workout, such as handstand push-up skill work before the workout Diane (21-15-9\nrepetitions of deadlifts and handstand push-ups). Such skill work can be done, but the trainer must monitor the\nvolume such that the athletes are not unduly fatigued. Each athlete has variable tolerance to pre-workout volume\nrelative to that athlete\u2019s capacity. The tolerance builds over time, so the warm-up can eventually be more extensive\nwithout pre-fatiguing muscles.\nTemplates can be used for weakness work. They can help keep a coach or athlete committed to dedicating time to\nskill development. However, it is important for coaches and athletes to use their judgment to change or break from\nthe template as necessary.\nScaling effectively\nScaling workouts appropriately for one\u2019s clients is an essential consideration to best increase their fitness. This is not"}
{"55": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\njust a concept for beginner clients; an effective trainer progresses the most athletes toward completing workouts as\nprescribed across months and years.\nTo scale effectively, a trainer needs to review the original workout for its intended stimulus, including:\n\u2022 movement functions,\n\u2022 loading parameters,\n\u2022 time frame, and\n\u2022 volume of repetitions.\nThis does not have to be a formal process, but it helps identify appropriate scaling options.\nSuppose an affiliate decided to post the workout Amanda (9-7-5 repetitions of muscle-ups and 135-lb. snatches) for\nits daily classes. This is a workout most members at most affiliates have to scale. The basic analysis of the workout\nvariables shows:\n1. a high-skill gymnastics movement that is an upper-body pull and push and a high-skill weightlifting\nmovement that is predominantly a lower-body pull and squat,\n2. the intended loading is moderate,\n3. the intended time is short (approximately 5 minutes), and\n4. the volume is low.\nThe goal for scaling this workout is to adhere to as many of these variables as possible in light of the individual\u2019s\ncapacity. The resulting scaled workout still needs to provide each client with a significant challenge. There is no single\nstrategy that works in every situation. Scaling is also a \u201cmoving target\u201d as individual capacities change over time.\nThere are some populations for which a trainer can employ common scaling strategies:\n1. beginners and/or deconditioned individuals,\n2. intermediate athletes,\n3. advanced athletes, and\n4. injured athletes.\nScaling guidelines, and examples for the workout Amanda, are detailed below.\nBeginners and/or deconditioned individuals are generally those athletes who have been doing CrossFit for six months\nor less. For beginner and/or deconditioned individuals, a trainer needs to be primarily concerned with adherence to\nthe proper points of performance of the movements throughout the full range of motion. Increasing the difficulty\n(via movements or volume) and/or pushing for greater intensity (via speed or load) are secondary to developing\nmovement proficiency and new skill development. This group may often include the elderly, where additional safety\nconcerns may be necessary (e.g., keeping feet on the floor). Beginners need a lot of guidance: The trainer must be\nproactive about approaching them and modifying the workout.\nLoads, distances, and repetitions are the primary variables to modify during scaling, particularly before changing the\nmovement. If a movement is beyond the athlete\u2019s current abilities, a substitution should create a similar movement\nfunction and range of motion. In some cases, preserving function and range of motion can be done by using severa\nmovements to achieve a similar effect. Also, it is not \u201cstandard\u201d to increase the volume of the substituted or \u201cless"}
{"56": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nchallenging\u201d movement. For example, it is not necessary to always make those substituting single-unders for dou-\nble-unders complete two or three times the repetitions. This group often needs reduced volume, even with a substi-\ntuted movement.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for beginners/deconditioned individuals include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Reduce to whatever allows the athlete to best practice the movement with full range\nof motion. This may be a training bar, empty barbell, or even PVC pipe. If the athlete has to go very light\nto preserve movement mechanics, consider doubling the repetition scheme. This gives the athlete more\npractice repetitions, which is the primary concern for the inexperienced. It is also possible to reduce the\nrange of motion in a loaded scenario if the mechanics cannot otherwise be preserved. Regardless of the\nscaling choice, the workout should provide some challenge across the repetitions.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. Replace with a simple upper-body pull and push. Most likely, this will be jumping\npull-ups or ring rows, and squat-assisted dips, bench dips, or push-ups. These options are mechanically\nsimple relative to the muscle-up, so a trainer needs to pick an option that provides a challenge to the\nathlete\u2019s upper-body strength across the total repetitions.\nAlthough not an exact guideline, the term \u201cintermediate athletes\u201d generally describes those who have been doing\nCrossFit for six months to three years. An intermediate athlete is one who can perform some workouts as prescribed\nbut still struggles with more complex movements or challenging repetition schemes and loads. Scaling the repeti-\ntions on some gymnastics movements and the loads on some weightlifting movements is the main priority. A trainer\nmust be mindful that an intermediate athlete is best served by using different scaling options each time a particular\nmovement or load appears in a workout. A trainer can create several different options for intermediate athletes\nnot only to avoid boredom, but also to help them continue to develop their fitness. Varying the manner in which a\nworkout is scaled reduces the timeframe needed to acquire the desired adaptation.\nWith time, intermediate athletes should be able to adequately scale their own workouts. This comes with a better\nunderstanding of workout goals and their own strengths and weaknesses. Intermediate athletes may be incor-\nrectly neglected at times because they require less guidance than the beginner. Nevertheless, the majority of one\u2019s\nmembers will likely be intermediate athletes with a wide range of abilities. These athletes still need to be pushed to\nnew levels as appropriate.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for intermediate athletes include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Intermediate athletes often include individuals who should stay at the prescribed\nweight and potentially take longer to complete the workout. Although their power output may be lower\nthan if the load was scaled, keeping the load as prescribed helps develop exactly the strength and\nstamina needed to perform the workout in a more competitive time. In cases where this load would\nnot be completed in any realistic time frame (i.e., would take more than 20 minutes), reduce the load\nappropriately.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. The scale is best when it is specific to the weakness, and it therefore does not take\non one specific form. If they have significant upper-body capacity in pull-ups and dips, an effective scale\nwould be to work a transition drill, as that is where their capacity is lacking (i.e., working the transition\nhelps strengthen a greater range of motion at the shoulder). Conversely, an intermediate athlete who"}
{"57": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nstruggles with pull-ups and dips may be better served using those movements in the workout to develop\nthe pushing and pulling stamina and strength of the upper body. Depending on proficiency, perhaps the\nrepetitions of pull-ups and dips should be increased. If there is an athlete who has muscle-ups but is not\nconsistent with them or cannot perform a high volume, reducing the repetitions is a viable option to help\ntrain the skill in a mixed-modal environment (e.g., repetitions of 5-4-3).\nAdvanced-level athletes are those who can perform all workouts and movements as prescribed. Typically, these\nathletes either came to CrossFit after years of performing some functional movements at high intensities (e.g., col-\nlegiate gymnast) or they have been doing CrossFit consistently for years. There are times a trainer needs to scale\nthis athlete due to sickness, injury, personal problems, or a recent string of difficult/demanding workouts. Occasion-\nally suggesting a variation with lower loading and/or repetitions benefits the advanced athlete both physically and/\nor mentally.\nThere may be an occasion to \u201cscale up\u201d an individual if the athlete is not challenged by the repetition scheme or weight\nor is in need of a different stimulus for skill development. The obvious options are to increase load or repetitions\nchoose different equipment (dumbbells vs. barbells), or make a movement more difficult (parallette vs. regular hand-\nstand push-ups). A trainer needs to be wary of this practice and should avoid consistently making workouts heavier\nand higher in volume to provide a \u201cchallenge.\u201d More often than not, the advanced athlete needs to be coached to\nbetter movement mechanics and/or greater intensity before making a workout \u201charder.\u201d An effective trainer needs to\nfocus on fixing movement inefficiencies and pushing for faster speeds before increasing the weights and repetitions\nThese corrections translate to seconds of gain in performance.\nCoaches need to be sure not to confuse advanced for elite, where elite is reserved for individuals actually going to the\nGames. Competitive programming is outside the scope of this course, as well as outside the scope of most affiliate\nneeds. At a minimum, athletes should be considered advanced before more volume is needed.\nSome potential scaling options for an advanced athlete in Amanda are listed below. There are infinite ways to tweak\nthe workout based on needs and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the athlete. These would be good options\nparticularly when an advanced athlete already has a competitive Amanda time.\n\u2022 Snatch. The snatch may be made heavier, may become a power variation, may be replaced with heavy\ndumbbells, etc.\n\u2022 Muscle-up. The muscle-ups may become bar muscle-ups, strict muscle-ups, weighted muscle-ups,\nmuscle-ups to forward rolls, etc.\nThe fourth category of participants includes the injured athlete. These individuals should be encouraged to par-\nticipate in the workout, as there is benefit to training even in their reduced capacity. There is a positive hormona\nresponse from exercise, which can affect a multitude of factors, from body weight to recovery to mental state\nAlthough the nature of injury determines what is possible, the goal is still the same: to replicate all workout variables\nas closely as possible.\nPain-free range of motion is the main guideline. Where the movement cannot be performed exactly, a trainer should\nfind a substitute that best replicates the basic function and/or range of motion. However, any movement that stil\nrelies primarily on the injured joint/body part should be used cautiously, if at all. A trainer may need to get creative at\ntimes to help athletes avoid boredom and keep an injured athlete working for new skill acquisition."}
{"58": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nSingle-limb work can be utilized: Contrary to the belief that this results in a problematic muscular imbalance, exer-\ncising the non-injured side can reduce atrophy in the injured side. Dumbbells are a perfect tool for one-sided work\nand the number of repetitions can increase in cases where the loading is limited. However, this should not be the\nonly option for someone with an injured limb. If an exercise involves two movement functions, an athlete may stil\nbe able to perform one with both sides. For example, in a thruster, an athlete with an injured upper body might stil\nbe able to squat or front squat. If the athlete has an injured lower body, he or she might still be able to press or push\npress. If there are no reasonable options for an injured person to perform a similar movement, omit the movement\nor substitute something else. This should be the last option considered.\nUsing the workout Amanda as an example, scaling options for injured athletes would take on many different forms\ndepending on the injury. Here are a couple of examples:\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s shoulder is injured such that he or she cannot support any load with one arm.\nPotentially, the snatch becomes a heavy dumbbell snatch on the good side, or it could become a 135-lb.\nback squat; the load could even be increased to be more challenging in the 9-7-5 repetition scheme. The\nmuscle-up may become a single-arm ring row and push-up or dumbbell press.\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s knee is injured such that he or she has limited flexion. The snatch may become a\nsnatch variation (power, muscle, hang) depending on the range of motion of the knee. The muscle-up\nwould not have to be scaled.\nWhen the injured side is cleared to be used again, the trainer must increase intensity very gradually, with a heavy\nemphasis on maintaining optimal mechanics to prevent additional injuries.\nImplementing scaling in a class environment\nAfter a trainer has analyzed the workout and knows what is likely to need scaling (especially movement substitutions)\ndirection must be given to the entire class to help each individual to the appropriate modification. While this can be\ndifficult in a busy class setting, a lot of scaling confusion can be prevented when the trainer introduces the workout\nto the class by indicating the intended stimulus or goal of the workout. Loading, repetition, time, and movement\nconsiderations can be discussed.\nPresenting several scaling options at this time can help keep the class moving. Some gyms present set scaling options\nthat keep large groups organized. This is fine, but a trainer must also recognize that the best choice for some athletes\nmay be an entirely different option. An experienced trainer should have no problem creating unique scaling options\nas necessary without taking away from class instruction and group cohesion.\nThe trainer also needs to observe clients as they increase loads and practice the movements in preparation for the\nworkout. An effective trainer can quickly see if the movement loading and repetition scheme chosen for the workout\nare appropriate by watching warm-up sets. There are times when scaling may have been assessed incorrectly and\na trainer needs to scale after the workout has begun. If an athlete is struggling too early in the workout and will not\nachieve the desired outcome, the trainer needs to adjust one or more of the workout variables mid-workout (e.g.\nload, repetitions). This is mandatory if an athlete cannot maintain safe mechanics. In these instances, it is important\nthat the trainer is firm with his or her decision. If he or she has built a good rapport with athletes, they should have\nno problem with such adjustments."}

Conversely, CrossFit programmers who do not regularly assess data can fall prey to\ncommon faults, some of which are described below.\n1. The first common error made by CrossFit programmers is a lack of regular assessment to determine\neffectiveness. Measurable results in performance markers are the guideposts for a programmer to\ndetermine whether the past programming was productive as well as what needs to be programmed next\nLack of assessment may occur from not repeating benchmark workouts and/or not recording results\nTrainers need to encourage members to record results to assist with this effort. Clients generally like this\nrecord of progress, particularly after months and years of hard work.\n2. Another error for CrossFit programmers occurs when variance is not applied correctly, and this is usually\nexpressed in one of three ways: randomization of workout variables, biasing certain variables, or emphasizing\nnon-essential elements. As mentioned above, optimal variance of workout variables requires intentiona\nplanning, not merely spinning the hopper and pulling out random tasks. A hopper may be used as a good\ntest of fitness (i.e., is an athlete ready for anything?), but it is not a good method to prepare for everything\nReliance on the hopper would leave to chance the broad, general, and inclusive adaptations CrossFit is"}
{"60": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\ntrying to develop. Programming via a hopper may be fun once in a while and can be used occasionally in\ncompetitions, but it is not a method by which to program for the best results.\nBiasing occurs when certain elements or combinations are repeated too often, with some elements avoided\ncompletely. There is nothing inherently bad about biasing as long as that is the intended goal. Biasing is a prob-\nlem if the goal is to develop general physical preparedness.\nAnother misapplication of variance is emphasizing non-essential elements. This appears as an endless\ncombination of workout variables, regardless of their utility or effect. For example, never repeating work-\nouts, performing lots of accessory or skill movements in actual workouts (e.g., Sots presses, single-leg work\nsport-specific drills), or focusing too much on environmental factors (e.g., working out with a gas mask or in the\nmiddle of the night) can be signs that variance is being misapplied. It can be easy for newer programmers to\nbelieve \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d programming provides a superior stimulus because of the novelty.\n3. A third common error in CrossFit programming is a lack of higher-skill development. This can occur when\ncertain movements are avoided in workouts or when warm-ups are not used to address weaknesses. A\ncurrent trend within the community is to avoid the more difficult gymnastics movements. CrossFit athletes\nare willing to tackle the technical weightlifting movements such as the snatch and clean and jerk but do not\nspend as much time developing the more technical counterparts in gymnastics, such as levers, planches\npresses to handstands, or pirouettes.\n4. CrossFit programmers may be tempted to use excessive volume. This occurs with more than one training\nsession a day (i.e., double days). In some cases, athletes may even attempt more than two sessions. This\npitfall affects those trying to emulate the volume sometimes used by CrossFit Games athletes. Games\nathletes\u2019 training is not representative of what CrossFit programming should look like. Multiple sessions a\nday are not appropriate for 99 percent of CrossFit athletes (less than one percent of those who participate\nin the Open go to the Games). Even multiple workouts in one extended \u201csession\u201d should generally be\navoided. Extra sessions and/or extra workouts may help performance in the short term but often lead to\novertraining, higher risk of injury, and burnout in the long term. Double days help Games athletes prepare\nfor high-volume competition and can help them get in more volume so they can advance certain skills\nrelative to their competitors. Generally, however, there is actually a decrease in intensity across sessions. As\nCoach Glassman said, \u201cBe impressed by intensity, not volume.\u201d If a client is looking to be competitive, very\ngradually and cautiously increase volume. For example, start with additional skill sessions (e.g., double-\nunder practice) in areas in which the athlete is not as proficient, not multiple workouts. Look at CrossFit\ncom and assess what the athlete cannot complete, then add \u201cvolume\u201d by way of working on these skills. The\nvolume should gradually increase over the long term.\n5. Another trickle-down effect from the Games is the assumption that the \u201cCrossFit standard\u201d for a movement\nis what is performed at the CrossFit Games. Standards in competition are set for ease of judging and do\nnot necessarily represent the best expression of the movement. They are used to establish the minimum\nrequirements for a repetition, and an athlete is held to those standards to ensure the range of motion is\nthe same across all competitors. Take, for example, hand-release push-ups: There is nothing better about\nthem in terms of muscular development or mechanical advantage. They are used because they are easier"}
{"61": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nto judge; a judge can easily ensure the chest and thighs make contact with the ground on every single\nrepetition. Standards in competitions should not prevent an athlete from using (or a trainer from teaching)\nmany different movement mechanics to develop a broad athletic capacity. There are different adaptations\nto all movements, and variations at the very least improve the overall coordination of an athlete who can\naccomplish a single task in multiple ways. CrossFit encourages athletes to learn all possible techniques and\nnot a single \u201cstandard\u201d (e.g., strict, chest-to-bar, kipping, and butterfly kipping pull-ups). This is another face\nof variance needed to develop the athletic capacity to accomplish tasks in multiple ways, and it is what wil\nbest prepare one for any test of fitness.\nConCLusion\nEffective programming occurs by applying basic tenets when selecting workout elements and combinations\nOptimizing long-term program design is best guided by observing results (i.e., objective and measurable change\nin performance markers) and applying focused weakness work or appropriate scaling. The elements of the daily\nworkouts are but one factor that affects how well an individual optimizes his or her fitness. Other factors, such as\neffective coaching and using intensity, need to be assessed to determine how best to make meaningful changes for\nimproved fitness."}

{"68": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nCLASS STRUCTURE AND LESSON PLANNING\nDuring the Level 2 Course, participants are led through a mock class from start to finish. It is meant to serve as a basic\nclass template for CrossFit affiliates. Although each example class at the Level 2 course is different\u2014from instructors\nto warm-up drills to workouts\u2014universally, there are themes that represent effective coaching practices.\nBeing a trainer is not about showing up, quickly writing a last-minute workout at the whiteboard, and turning on the\nmusic. Real training is about improving each client\u2019s fitness (and by association quality of life) in small, incremental\nsteps in a motivating and positive way. Besides having the presence, attitude, and demonstration skills to develop a\npositive rapport with one\u2019s clients (see \u201cFoundations of Effective Training\u201d), a large part of improving client fitness is\nhaving a plan, both on a day-to-day and long-term basis. This section discusses the basic but necessary components\na trainer needs to run a single class.\nTo effectively manage time, trainers need to have a lesson plan. A single class can be outlined as a four-part lesson\nplan consisting of:\n\u2022 Introduction\n\u2022 Warm-Up\n\u2022 Workout\n\u2022 Post-Workout\nThe total time of the workout helps set the allotted time for the warm-up and cool-down sections. A longer workout\nmeans sacrificing time in either or both. Most affiliates run hour-long classes, and this is the length used in the Level\n2 example class.\nLogistical considerations affect an appropriate workout to select, as well as the time allotted to each component of\nthe class. Factors include gear availability, class size, gym space (for equipment and athlete layout), and the expe-\nrience level of the class. A trainer needs to consider various alternatives because additional modifications may be\nnecessary on the fly, depending on the experience level of the clients and how many show up. For example, if the\naffiliate has limited floor space, it will not take many participants to make it cramped. For safety considerations, a\ntrainer needs to ensure there are walkable areas between all moving athletes and their equipment. Dumbbells are\na phenomenal tool for athletes; they are great space savers, as well as substitutes for barbells in many scenarios.\nTrainers may also use sandbags, the outdoors, staggered heats, etc. Trainers are limited only by their knowledge\nand creativity.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction, although the shortest element of a class, is of great importance. During the introduction\n(commonly referred to as the time \u201cat the whiteboard\u201d), the coach will brief the workout, set expectations by explain-\ning the intended stimulus, offer several scaling options, and take any questions. Generally, the introduction will take\nbetween two and four minutes, depending on the complexity of the workout and the number of participants taking\nclass. Having more participants increases the likelihood of questions. The introduction should serve to clear up any\nconfusion about the workout while also reducing pre-workout anxiety."}
{"69": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nWarm-up\nThe purpose of the warm-up is to do just that: warm the body in preparation for intense activity. Warm-ups often\nconsist of two parts: a general warm-up and a specific warm-up. The main goal of a general warm-up is to stimulate\nthe body\u2019s physiological functions\u2014i.e., increase core temperature and blood flow to the muscles, prime the car-\ndiorespiratory system, increase mobility, and move joints through a full range of motion. General warm-ups usually\ninclude calisthenic-type movements or movements that involve dynamic ranges of motion.\nThe primary goals of a specific warm-up are to build, practice, and refine proper mechanics for the movements that\nwill be used in the workout, and to prepare mentally and physically for the challenge. Specific warm-ups present an\nopportunity for movement assessment and appropriate scaling. However, potentially different ranges of motion\nand/or variations may be used (e.g., power vs. squat variations, medicine balls vs. barbells) where necessary.\nMovements that are not part of the workout may also be used in the warm-up, as the warm-up element also provides\nan opportunity to improve deficiencies in any movements (i.e., practicing handstands even though handstands may\nnot be in the workout). Typically, these options are reserved for shorter, lower-skill workouts that do not require a\nsignificant amount of time to prepare for (i.e., rowing 1,000 meters for time or running a timed mile). The \u201cProgram\nDesign and Scaling\u201d article discusses how to use this time as focused weakness work.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and coach in the warm-up period. The warm-up helps athletes best prepare\nto handle the demands of the workout and improve upon deficiencies, whether they are subtle mechanical ineffi-\nciencies in more experienced athletes or larger faults in movements with which athletes have little experience. The\nwarm-up also provides the trainer with an opportunity to assess the athletic capacity of an individual relative to\nthe intended stimulus. Following the assessment/practice period, it is time for the trainer to assign scaling options\nAlthough the trainer should have some ideas before starting a class, it isn\u2019t until after actually assessing athletes\nneeds that a trainer can choose the most effective option(s). As discussed in the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article\nscaling should progress with the athletes, and they should be constantly challenged (i.e., they should not just perform\nthe same scale every time a movement, rep range, or prescribed load is outside their current capacity). Beyond\nassessment and scaling, the warm-up is also the time for the coach to mentally prepare the athletes and oversee any\nremaining workout logistics (e.g., equipment distribution, equipment layout, heats, safety checks).\nA pre-workout break is not one of the main elements of a lesson plan, but it is needed and useful for a coach. The\npre-workout break includes safety and equipment checks, room layout, workout flow, additional scaling, questions\nfrom the athletes, a bathroom opportunity, and of course, the workout re-brief.\nThe workout re-brief is there to remind the athletes what the workout is (order of movements, repetition scheme\nand rounds or time) and the range-of-motion standards that are required. A coach needs to clearly demonstrate and\nemphasize the range of motion and mechanics for every movement before every single workout. This makes it easier\nto hold athletes to these standards during the workout and cultivate a culture of virtuosity in one\u2019s gym.\nWe must remember, especially for newer athletes, workout abbreviations and acronyms on the whiteboard are not\nself-evident. A coach may choose to discuss scaling options with the entire class at this time or even review the\nintended stimulus of the workout. This could potentially include describing the targeted time domain, loading, or skil\nacquisition. For example, the workout Elizabeth (21-15-9 repetitions of cleans at 135 lb. and ring dips) is a relatively\nshort workout (about 5 min.), with moderate loading. Novice CrossFit athletes likely have to reduce the load for the"}
{"70": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nclean to their level of moderate loading (e.g., 95 lb.), and they might have to address the dips\u2019 load (e.g., band, bench)\nor volume (e.g., 12-9-6) to best match the original workout intent. See the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article for\nmore information about preserving the intended stimulus.\nWhether in the pre-workout brief or the specific warm-up, time should be allotted for athletes to practice the exact\nstandards to be used in the workout. If the movement is loaded, additional time is needed for athletes to work up to\nan appropriate load under the discretion of the trainer.\nWorkout\nOnce the workout begins, the demands on a coach\u2019s abilities increase. Coaching is not about repetition counting\ncheering, or selecting music. It is about appropriately applying threshold training, which means pushing an athlete\u2019s\nintensity while maintaining sound mechanics. This balance is what helps minimize the risk for injury but also keeps\nthe intensity high to drive progress. Deviations in mechanics are inevitable as athletes try to move fast to complete\nthe workout. A coach must attend to each client, using as many different cueing strategies as possible or needed\nand offering encouragement and reinforcement of sound mechanics throughout the workout. A coach may find that\nhe or she actually has to slow an athlete down and/or lower the load, as well as potentially stop them, if there is no\nimprovement in mechanics across multiple repetitions. Movement change is not reserved only for the warm-up. It\nmust continue throughout the workout. A coach is expected to make athletes better during the workout.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and the coach during the workout. The athlete will receive increased fitness\nadaptations from appropriately increasing speed and load. In addition, he or she should be receiving feedback from\nthe coach on how to improve and refine movement. The coach benefits in this scenario by learning and developing\nseeing and correcting skills in a faster, more dynamic, and less-controlled environment. The ability to deliver action-\nable and effective cues for better movement improves with experience while coaching under high intensity. It is a\npractical, real-time learning opportunity that is focused on effective coaching strategies related to both the athlete\u2019s\nmechanics and motivation.\nPost-workout\nThe main purpose of the post-workout element is to cool down the athletes and program items that will aid in\nrecovery, regaining mental acuity, slowing heart rates and breathing, and facilitating full range of motion about the\njoints (i.e., regaining homeostasis). The coach may also have some secondary goals for this period, such as additiona\nskill work, fitness challenges, education for the athlete, and preparation of the space for the next class. Regardless\na well-conducted post-workout session must include a proper cool-down that leaves clients prepared for the rest of\ntheir day, capable and eager to return and full of appreciation for their accomplishments.\nSome examples of possible cool-down elements are described below. Generally, the cool-down should begin by just\nallowing the athletes to recover for a few minutes. While the athletes are warm and pliable, the cool-down is an excel-\nlent time to stretch or foam roll, especially the areas that were taxed heavily. This can aid recovery, reducing soreness\nwhile potentially helping athletes to gain new range of motion. A coach may leave this as an open period, allowing\nmembers to choose which drills are best for them. A coach-led session, however, ensures everyone has direction\nattention, motivation, and a sense of togetherness.\nA trainer may choose to include skill work at the end of a workout. This can include a review of the movements\nused, especially to correct errors that may have presented themselves during the workout. Using reduced speed and"}
{"71": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nload, the trainer can reinforce sound movement mechanics before the athlete leaves. If a trainer filmed an athlete\u2019s\nmovement during the workout, this period can include video playback to review his or her technique. It is also possible\nto work on a totally unrelated skill. While practice is more difficult after a workout due to fatigue, this is precisely why\nattempting new skills here can be beneficial (heightened neurological adaptations due to muscular fatigue).\nA post-workout may include a finisher\u2014an impromptu fitness test such as a maximum set of pull-ups, handstand\nwalking, or rope climbs\u2014anything. It can be part of an ongoing record or a competition, and it can be used as a moti-\nvational event or a chance to reinforce the unknown and unknowable nature of life\u2019s challenges. For example, finish-\ners may be grouped into teams or partners, or the challenge may be structured so one or two athletes compete at a\ntime and the rest of the class can cheer. As in a warm-up, a coach needs to be mindful that finishers do not become\na second workout, nor do they have to be part of every class.\nA coach can use the post-workout period to ensure athletes are recording their workouts. Especially on benchmark\ndays (including strength days), the coach should encourage members to write down their times, repetitions, loads\nand scaling or modifications. The coach should also be able to tell the members the last date the workout was com-\npleted for comparison.\nFinally, a coach can use this time as an educational opportunity to talk about nutrition, programming, scaling, \u201cWhat\nIs Fitness?\u201d or \u201cWhat is CrossFit?\u201d etc., all with the intention of creating smarter athletes.\nThe post-workout/cool-down period gives the coach time to survey athletes and look for mental faculties and visible\nsigns of injury or physical distress. A coach needs to pay attention to verbal and nonverbal cues that an athlete may\nbe under duress. This is also a time for the coach to engage in conversation with athletes by offering encouragement\nand feedback on performance and asking about their physical responses to the workout. Such conversations provide\nvaluable information about the coach\u2019s or facility\u2019s programming. These small connections also lay the groundwork\nfor building a strong community and meaningful relationships with one\u2019s members. The post-workout period is an\noften overlooked or rushed section of class, but it is valuable time, and a coach should use it wisely.\nTo be effective in each class, not only does a coach have to have capacity in all six areas discussed in the \u201cFoundations\nof Effective Training\u201d article, but one must also have a plan. This plan covers all aspects of the class to best improve\none\u2019s athletes with each training session while keeping them safe and excited to return for the next day. After each\nsession, an informal review and critique of one\u2019s own class performance can help the coach better prepare for sub-\nsequent sessions.

We sought to build a program that would best prepare trainees for\nany physical contingency\u2014prepare them not only for the unknown but for the un-\nknowable. Looking at all sport and physical tasks collectively, we asked what physi-\ncal skills and adaptations would most universally lend themselves to performance\nadvantage. Capacity culled from the intersection of all sports demands would\nquite logically lend itself well to all sport. In sum, our specialty is not specializing.\nPRESCRIPTION\nCrossFit is: \u201cconstantly varied, high-intensity functional movement.\u201d This is our\nprescription. Functional movements are universal motor recruitment patterns;\nthey are performed in a wave of contraction from core to extremity; and they are\ncompound movements\u2014i.e., they are multi-joint. They are natural, effective, and\nefficient locomotors of body and external objects. But no aspect of functional\nmovements is more important than their capacity to move large loads over long\ndistances, and to do so quickly. Collectively, these three attributes (load, distance,\nand speed) uniquely qualify functional movements for the production of high pow-\ner. Intensity is defined exactly as power, and intensity is the independent variable\nmost commonly associated with maximizing the rate of return of favorable adap-\ntation to exercise. Recognizing that the breadth and depth of a program\u2019s stimulus\nwill determine the breadth and depth of the adaptation it elicits, our prescription\nof functionality and intensity is constantly varied. We believe that preparation for\nrandom physical challenges\u2014i.e., unknown and unknowable events\u2014is at odds\nwith fixed, predictable, and routine regimens."}
{"5": "METHODOLOGY\nThe methodology that drives CrossFit is entirely empirical. We believe that mean-\ningful statements about safety, efficacy, and efficiency, the three most important\nand interdependent facets to evaluate any fitness program, can be supported only\nby measurable, observable, repeatable data. We call this approach \u201cevidence-based\nfitness.\u201d CrossFit\u2019s methodology depends on full disclosure of methods, results,\nand criticisms, and we have employed the internet to support these values. Our\ncharter is open source, making co-developers out of participating coaches, ath-\nletes, and trainers through a spontaneous and collaborative online community.\nCrossFit is empirically driven, clinically tested, and community developed.\nIMPLEMENTATION We\u2019ve take\nIn implementation, CrossFit is, quite simply, a sport\u2014the Sport of Fitness.

{"8": "Aside from the breadth or totality of fitness CrossFit seeks, our program is dis-\ntinctive, if not unique, in its focus on maximizing neuroendocrine response, de-\nveloping power, cross-training with multiple training modalities, constant training\nand practice with functional movements, and the development of successful\ndiet strategies.\nOur athletes are trained to bike, run, swim, and row at short, middle, and long\ndistances, guaranteeing exposure and competency in each of the three main met-\nabolic pathways.\nWe train our athletes in gymnastics from rudimentary to advanced movements,\ngarnering great capacity at controlling the body both dynamically and statically\nwhile maximizing strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility. We also place a heavy\nemphasis on Olympic weightlifting, having seen this sport\u2019s unique ability to devel-\nop an athlete\u2019s explosive power, control of external objects, and mastery of critical\nmotor recruitment patterns. And finally we encourage and assist our athletes to\nexplore a variety of sports as a vehicle to express and apply their fitness.\nAN EFFECTIVE APPROACH\nIn gyms and health clubs throughout the world the typical workout consists of\nisolation movements and extended aerobic sessions. The fitness community from\ntrainers to the magazines has the exercising public believing that lateral raises,\ncurls, leg extensions, sit-ups and the like combined with 20- to 40-minute stints on\nthe stationary bike or treadmill are going to lead to some kind of great fitness. Well,\nat CrossFit we work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high-in-\ntensity cardiovascular sessions. We have replaced the lateral raise with the push\npress, the curl with the pull-up, and the leg extension with the squat. For every\nlong-distance effort our athletes will do five or six at short distance. Why? Because\nfunctional movements and high intensity are radically more effective at eliciting\nnearly any desired fitness result. Startlingly, this is not a matter of opinion but\nsolid, irrefutable scientific fact, and yet the marginally effective old ways persist\nand are nearly universal. Our approach is consistent with what is practiced in elite"}
{"9": "training programs associated with major university athletic teams and profession-\nal sports. CrossFit endeavors to bring state-of-the-art coaching techniques to the\ngeneral public and athlete.\nIS THIS FOR ME?\nAbsolutely! Your needs and the Olympic athlete\u2019s differ by degree not kind. In-\ncreased power, speed, strength, cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, flexibility,\nstamina, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy are each important to the\nworld\u2019s best athletes and to our grandparents. The amazing truth is that the very\nsame methods that elicit optimal response in the Olympic or professional athlete\nwill optimize the same response in the elderly. Of course, we cannot load your\ngrandmother with the same squatting weight that we would assign an Olympic\nskier, but they both need to squat. In fact, squatting is essential to maintaining\nfunctional independence and improving fitness. Squatting is just one example\nof a movement that is universally valuable and essential yet rarely taught to any\nbut the most advanced of athletes. This is a tragedy. Through painstakingly thor-\nough coaching and incremental load assignment, CrossFit has been able to teach\neveryone who can care for himself or herself to perform safe-\nly and with maximum efficacy the same movements typically\nutilized by professional coaches in elite and certainly exclusive\nenvironments.\nWHO HAS BENEFITED FROM CROSSFIT?\nMany professional and elite athletes are participating in CrossFit.\nPrizefighters, cyclists, surfers, skiers, tennis players, triathletes\nand others competing at the highest levels are using CrossFit to\nadvance their core strength and conditioning, but that is not all.\nCrossFit has tested its methods on the sedentary, overweight,\npathological, and elderly and found that these special popula-\ntions met the same success as our stable of athletes.

{"10": "JUST WHAT IS A \u201cCORE STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING\u201d PROGRAM?\nCrossFit is a core strength and conditioning program in two distinct senses. First,\nwe are a core strength and conditioning program in the sense that the fitness\nwe develop is foundational to all other athletic\nneeds. This is the same sense in which the uni-\nversity courses required of a particular major\nare called the \u201ccore curriculum.\u201d This is the stuff\nthat everyone needs. Second, we are a \u201ccore\u201d\nstrength and conditioning program in the literal\nsense meaning the center of something. Much\nof our work focuses on the major functional axis\nof the human body, the extension and flexion\nof the hips and torso or trunk. The primacy of\ncore strength and conditioning in this sense is\nsupported by the simple observation that pow-\nerful hip extension alone is necessary and near-\nly sufficient for elite athletic performance. That\nis, our experience has been that no one without\nthe capacity for powerful hip extension enjoys\ngreat athletic prowess and nearly everyone we\nhave met with that capacity was a great athlete.\nRunning, jumping, punching, and throwing all\noriginate at the core. At CrossFit we endeavor\nto develop our athletes from the inside out, from core to extremity, which is, by\nthe way, how good functional movements recruit muscle, from the core to the\nextremities.\nCAN I ENJOY OPTIMAL HEALTH WITHOUT BEING AN ATHLETE?\nNo! Athletes experience a protection from the ravages of aging and disease that\nnon-athletes never find. For instance, 80-year-old athletes are stronger than\nnon-athletes in their prime at 25 years old. If you think that strength is not import-\nant, consider that strength loss is what puts people in nursing homes. Athletes\nhave greater bone density, stronger immune systems, less coronary heart dis-"}
{"11": "WHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO BE AN ATHLETE; I JUST WANT TO BE HEALTHY?\nYou are in luck. We hear this often, but the truth is that fitness, wellness, and pa-\nthology (sickness) are measures of the same entity: your health. There are a mul-\ntitude of measurable parameters that can be ordered from sick (pathological) to\nwell (normal) to fit (better than normal). These include but are not limited to blood\npressure, cholesterol, heart rate, body fat, muscle mass, flexibility, and strength.\nIt seems as though all of the body functions that can go awry have states that are\npathological, normal, and exceptional and that elite athletes typically show these\nparameters in the exceptional range. CrossFit\u2019s view is that fitness and health are\nthe same thing (see \u201cWhat Is Fitness? (Part 1)\u201d article). It is also interesting to notice\nthat the health professional maintains your health with drugs and surgery, each\nwith potentially undesirable side effects, whereas the CrossFit trainer typically\nachieves a superior result always with \u201cside benefit\u201d versus side effect.\nEXAMPLES OF CROSSFIT EXERCISES\nBiking, running, swimming, and rowing in an endless variety of drills. The clean and\njerk, snatch, squat, deadlift, push press, bench press, and power clean. Jumping,\nmedicine-ball throws and catches, pull-ups, dips, push-ups, handstands, presses\nto handstands, pirouettes, kips, cartwheels, muscle-ups, sit-ups, scales, and holds.\nWe make regular use of bikes, the track, rowing shells and ergometers, Olympic\nweight sets, rings, parallel bars, free exercise mats, horizontal bars, plyometrics\nboxes, medicine balls, and jump ropes.\nThere is not a strength and conditioning program anywhere that works with a\ngreater diversity of tools, modalities, and drills.\nWHAT IF I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF THIS?\nIt is a common sentiment to feel that because of the obligations of career and fami-\nly that you do not have the time to become as fit as you might like. Here is the good\nnews: World-class age group strength and conditioning is obtainable through an\nhour a day six days per week of training. It turns out that the intensity of training\nthat optimizes physical conditioning is not sustainable past 45 minutes to an hour.\nAthletes who train for hours a day are developing skill or training for sports that in-"}
{"12": "physical skills (cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, flexibility, strength,\npower, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy). The excessive aero-\nbic volume of the endurance athletes\u2019 training costs them in speed, power, and\nstrength to the point that their athletic competency has been compromised. No\ntriathlete is in ideal shape to wrestle, box, pole-vault, sprint, play any ball sport,\nfight fires, or do police work. Each of these requires a fitness level far beyond the\nneeds of the endurance athlete. None of this suggests that being a marathoner,\ntriathlete or other endurance athlete is a bad thing; just do not believe that training\nas a long-distance athlete gives you the fitness that is prerequisite to many sports.\nCrossFit considers the sumo wrestler, triathlete, marathoner, and powerlifter to\nbe \u201cfringe athletes\u201d in that their fitness demands are so specialized as to be incon-\nsistent with the adaptations that give maximum competency at all physical chal-\nlenges. Elite strength and conditioning is a compromise between each of the 10\nphysical adaptations. Endurance athletes do not balance that compromise.\nAEROBICS AND ANAEROBICS\nThere are three main energy systems that fuel all human activity. Almost all chang-\nes that occur in the body due to exercise are related to the demands placed on\nthese energy systems. Furthermore, the efficacy of any given fitness regimen may\nlargely be tied to its ability to elicit an adequate stimulus for change within these\nthree energy systems.\nEnergy is derived aerobically when oxygen is utilized to metabolize substrates de-\nrived from food and liberates energy. An activity is termed aerobic when the ma-\njority of energy needed is derived aerobically. These activities are usually greater\nthan 90 seconds in duration and involve low to moderate power output or inten-\nsity. Examples of aerobic activity include running on the treadmill for 20 minutes,\nswimming a mile, and watching TV.\nEnergy is derived anaerobically when energy is liberated from substrates in the\nabsence of oxygen.

{"13": "It warrants mention that in any activity all three energy systems are utilized\nthough one may dominate. The interplay of these systems can be complex, yet a\nsimple examination of the characteristics of aerobic versus anaerobic training can\nprove useful.\nCrossFit\u2019s approach is to judiciously balance anaerobic and aerobic exercise in a\nmanner that is consistent with the athlete\u2019s goals. Our exercise prescriptions ad-\nhere to proper specificity, progression, variation, and recovery to optimize\nadaptations.\nTHE OLYMPIC LIFTS, A.K.A., WEIGHTLIFTING\nThere are two Olympic lifts, the clean and jerk and\nthe snatch. Mastery of these lifts develops the\nsquat, deadlift, power clean, and split jerk while\nintegrating them into a single movement of un-\nequaled value in all of strength and conditioning.\nThe Olympic lifters are without a doubt the world\u2019s\nstrongest athletes.\nThese lifts train athletes to effectively activate more\nmuscle fibers more rapidly than through any other\nmodality of training. The explosiveness that results\nfrom this training is of vital necessity to every sport.\nPracticing the Olympic lifts teaches one to apply\nforce to muscle groups in proper sequence; i.e.,\nfrom the center of the body to its extremities (core\nto extremity). Learning this vital technical lesson benefits all athletes who need\nto impart force to another person or object, as is commonly required in near-\nly all sports.\nIn addition to learning to impart explosive forces, the clean and jerk and snatch\ncondition the body to receive such forces from another moving body both safely"}

This places a unique premi-\num on the improvement of strength-to-weight ratio. Unlike other strength training\nmodalities, gymnastics and calisthenics allow for increases in strength only while\nincreasing strength-to-weight ratio!\nGymnastics develops pull-ups, squats, lunges, jumping, push-ups, and numerous\npresses to handstand, scales, and holds. These skills are unrivaled in their benefit\nto the physique, as evident in any competitive gymnast.\nAs important as the capacity of this modality is for strength development, it is with-\nout a doubt the ultimate approach to improving coordination, balance, agility, ac-\ncuracy, and flexibility. Through the use of numerous presses, handstands, scales,\nand other floor work, the gymnast\u2019s training greatly enhances kinesthetic sense.\nThe variety of movements available for inclusion in this modality probably exceeds\nthe number of exercises known to all non-gymnastic sport! The rich variety here\ncontributes substantially to CrossFit\u2019s ability to inspire great athletic confidence\nand prowess.\nFor a combination of strength, flexibility, well-developed physique, coordina-\ntion, balance, accuracy, and agility, the gymnast has no equal in the sports world.\nThe inclusion of this training modality is absurdly absent from nearly all train-\ning programs.\nROUTINES\nThere is no ideal routine! In fact, the chief value of any routine lies in abandon-\ning it for another. The CrossFit ideal is to train for any contingency. The obvious\nimplication is that this is possible only if there is a tremendously varied quality to\nthe breadth of stimulus.

{"18": "WHAT SHOULD I EAT?\nIn plain language, base your diet on garden vegetables (especially greens), meats,\nnuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar. That is about as simple as we\ncan get. Many have observed that keeping your grocery cart to the perimeter of the\ngrocery store while avoiding the aisles is a great way to protect your health.

Coronary heart disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoporo-\nsis, obesity, and psychological dysfunction have all been scientifically linked to a\ndiet too high in refined or processed carbohydrate. The caveman model is perfect-\nly consistent with CrossFit\u2019s prescription.\nWHAT FOODS SHOULD I AVOID?\nExcessive consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates is the primary culprit in\nnutritionally caused health problems. High-glycemic carbohydrates are those that\nraise blood sugar too rapidly. They include rice, bread, candy, potato, sweets, so-\ndas, and most processed carbohydrates. Processing can include bleaching, bak-\ning, grinding, and refining. Processing of carbohydrates greatly increases their\nglycemic index, a measure of their propensity to elevate blood sugar.\nWHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH HIGH-GLYCEMIC CARBOHYDRATES?\nThe problem with high-glycemic carbohydrates is that in excess they give an inor-\ndinate insulin response. Insulin is an essential hormone for life, yet acute, chron-\nic elevation of insulin leads to hyperinsulinism, which has been positively linked\nto obesity, elevated cholesterol levels, blood pressure, mood dysfunction, and a\nPandora\u2019s box of disease and disability.

Powerlifting is a superb start to a lifting pro-\ngram followed later by the more dynamic clean and the jerk and finally the clean\nand jerk and the snatch.\nThe movements that we are recommending are very demanding and very athletic.\nAs a result they have kept athletes interested and intrigued where the typical fare\noffered in most gyms (bodybuilding movements) typically bores athletes to dis-\ntraction. Weightlifting is sport; weight training is not.\nTHROWING\nOur program includes not only weightlifting and powerlifting but also throwing\nwork with medicine balls.

Sport is the application of fitness in a fan-\ntastic atmosphere of competition and mastery. Training efforts typically include\nrelatively predictable repetitive movements and provide limited opportunity for\nthe essential combination of our 10 general physical skills. It is, after all, the com-\nbined expression, or application, of the 10 general skills that is our motivation for\ntheir development in the first place. Sports and games like soccer, martial arts,\nbaseball, and basketball, in contrast to our training workouts, have more varied\nand less predictable movements. But, where sports develop and require all 10\ngeneral skills simultaneously, they do so slowly compared to our strength and con-\nditioning regimen. Sport is better, in our view, at expression and testing of skills\nthan it is at developing these same skills. Both expression and development are\ncrucial to our fitness.

They produced a list of physiological adaptations that represented\nthe gamut of potential physiological adaptations in an exercise program. You\ncan improve cardiorespiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power,\nspeed, coordination, accuracy, agility and balance by exercising. They gave rea-\nsonable definitions to each of these 10 so that they seemed fairly distinct. Keep\nin mind, however, nature has no obligation to recognize these distinctions.

{"36": "We have countless examples of this from amateur and professional sports. At the\nheart of this is that we have learned some things about GPP that the world never\nknew before. There is more opportunity of advancing athletic performance via\nadvancing GPP than there is in more sport-specific strength and conditioning\ntraining. For example, I am not sure why more pull-ups make for better skiers,\nbut they do. We have some theories why that occurs, but we do not actually need\nto know the mechanism. We are focused on advancing performance.\nSo the second model is a statistical model using skills and drills. I am looking for a\nbalance of capacity across training modalities.\nThe third model uses the three metabolic pathways. These are the three engines\nthat produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the currency of effort of all energy\noutput. Power is plotted on the Y-axis and duration of effort (time) on the X-axis.\nThe first pathway (phosphagen or phosphocreatine) is high powered and short\nduration. It can account for about 100 percent of max human output and taps out\nat about 10 seconds. The second pathway (lactate or glycolytic) is moderate pow-\nered, moderate duration. It accounts for approximately 70 percent of max pow-\ner output, peaks at about 60 seconds and terminates at 120 seconds. The third\npathway (oxidative or aerobic) is low powered, long duration. It accounts for ap-\nproximately 40 percent of max power output and does not fade in any reasonable\ntime for which I have the patience to measure. The phosphagen and the glycolytic\npathways are anaerobic; oxidative is aerobic. All three engines work all the time to\nsome extent. The degree to which each is active is dependent on the activity. One\nidles, while the other two rev; two will rev, one will idle, etc.\nOur thought is this: He or she is as fit as he or she is balanced in capacity in all\nthree of these engines. A human being is a vehicle with three engines. Suppose we\ndiscover there is a fourth engine; we want capacity there, too. We develop capacity\nin all engines through our prescription: constantly varied functional movement\nexecuted at high intensity.

For example, maximal oxygen\nconsumption (VO2 max) and lactate threshold are correlates, maybe components,\nbut absolutely subordinate to what happens to work capacity. Who would take an\nincrease in VO2max for a decrease in work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains?

This would be similar to a group of athletes competing in 25\nto 30 workouts.

This means measurable, observ-\nable, repeatable data is used in analyzing and assessing a fitness program. There\nare three meaningful components to analysis of a fitness program: safety, efficacy,\nand efficiency.\nThe efficacy of a program means, \u201cWhat is the return?\u201d Maybe a fitness program\nadvertises that it will make you a better soccer player.

And people were like: \u201cYou are kidding me?\u201d and \u201cFat makes you fat, right?\u201d\nIt is not true.\nOPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE\nThe next layer to diet is about optimizing performance. Through a diet of meat\nand vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, no sugar, you will not be\nso lucky as to optimize your output. To get a sub-three-minute Fran, you need to\nweigh and measure your meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, fruit and starch,\nand you need to eliminate sugar.\nI wish it were not true. I wish the path of fitness was riding bicycles and drinking\nbeer. I wished that is how we did it. It does not work. What you have to do is eat\nmeat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, no sugar, and then\nget a scale and measuring cup. You need accuracy and precision to your consump-\ntion or you will never get in a jet stream of elite performance.\nIf you want to have top-fuel-type performance, you need top fuel. I wish it were\notherwise. What do I base this on? No one has ever demonstrated to me anything\nbut inferior capacity on a diet where they did not weigh and measure.\nI am not telling you that you have to weigh and measure your food. But I am telling\nyou that you are not going to get anywhere in terms of optimizing your perfor-\nmance on a bad diet. And we have seen enough incidences now. I have worked\nwith tens of thousands of people: No one has ever done it.\nYou need to weigh and measure your food. Not forever, but at least to start. It is\nalso good to go back to weighing and measuring once in a while. What happens is"}
{"51": "further. It is possible you will get too lean to perform well. You may find a plateau in\nyour output, and then you need to ratchet it up. (I do the same thing for hard gain-\ners; I increase their intake as I do not need them to lean out.) The first step: When\nyou get as lean as you want to be and before there is a diminution in performance,\ndouble the fat. If you do not feel a whole lot better, maybe try three times the fat.\nAnd if that does not feel a whole lot better, and instead you just get thicker, then go\nback to two times the fat. But I would let performance tell me what to do. In making\nmodifications, I want to see any kind of change in physiognomy. I have more room\nto play with when someone has extra padding; I have to be more careful with\nsomeone who is already ripped.\nThe formula for calculating what is relevant and pertinent to your prescription is\nlean body mass and activity level. Done. There is not an inherent difference for\nmen versus women, for young versus old. I want to know how active you are and\nI want to know what your lean body mass is. And everything else is not germane,\nnot pertinent, not relevant. It is extraneous information.\nIn the vagaries and contingencies of everyday living, such as schedules and appe-\ntite, there are fluctuations in intake that will occur without weighing and measur-\ning. Following these normal fluctuations puts you on a coarser path versus the fine\npath required for optimized performance. And that is why you will not get there by\nluck. It is also possible an average CrossFit athlete becomes extraordinary this way.\nCommitment and focus are going to overcome genetic limitations. If you commit\nto the effort, you stand a much better chance. We have had this fantastic experi-\nence of playing with this. In any cohort, one pulls away when he or she is weighing\nand measuring food in this 40-30-30 milieu of macronutrient intake."}
{"52": "FITNESS, LUCK AND HEALTH\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s Feb. 27, 2016, L1 lecture in San Jose, California; March 27,\n2016, L1 lecture in Aromas, California; and April 24, 2016, L1 lecture in Oakland, California.\nIn 2002, we observed that almost any health parameter sits well ordered on a con-\ntinuum of values that ranged from sick to well to fit. High-density lipoproteins (HDL\ncholesterol), for instance: At less than 35 mg/dL you have a problem, 50 mg/dL is\nnice, and 75 mg/dL is a whole lot better. Blood pressure: 195/115 mm/Hg you have\na problem, 120/70 mm/Hg is healthy, and 105/50 mm/Hg looks more like an ath-\nlete. Triglycerides, bone density, muscle mass, body fat, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c,\naka glycated hemoglobin)\u2014all can be plotted relative to these three values.\nThe significance is that these are the predictors, the cause, and the manifesta-\ntion of chronic disease. Chronic diseases include obesity, coronary heart disease,\nType 2 diabetes, stroke, cancer (to include breast, colon and lung, but my theory\nis this will include all the positron-emission-tomography-positive cancers eventu-\nally, which are 95 percent of all cancers), Alzheimer\u2019s, peripheral artery disease,\nadvanced biological aging, drug addiction, among others.\nIt is very likely that if you have any chronic disease, you have deranged markers. If\nyou have Alzheimer\u2019s, you would see your HDL suppressed, your blood pressure\nup, your triglycerides up, your body fat up, your muscle mass down, your bone\ndensity down, your HbA1c high, etc. The same is true with diabetes. The same is\ntrue with most cancers.\nMedicine has no effective treatment for chronic disease: It is symptomatic only.\nThe doctor gives you a drug to bring your cholesterol down, a different drug to\nraise your bone density. You might need bariatric surgery if you have morbid obe-\nsity. If you have paved-over coronary arteries, they can do bypass surgery. If you\nbecome glucose intolerant, the doctor can put you on insulin. But all of these are\nnot fixes. They are masking the problem. If you have persistent malignant hyper-\ntension, you should take an antihypertensive if you cannot get your blood pres-"}

The numbers are ris-\ning, and when we finally add the positron-emission-tomography-positive cancers\nin, the number might be 80-85 percent in the U.S. It is estimated by the Centers for\nDisease Control (CDC) that the U.S. could have up to a hundred million diabetics in\n2050. That will affect everyone. You will not go into the emergency room for some-\nthing as simple as a broken arm: You will be seeing heart attacks on every corner.\nMedicine has no solution; you do. CrossFit, with meat and vegetables, nuts and\nseeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar, will help you avoid all of this.\nThe other 30 percent are dying from accidents that come in four \u201c-ic\u201d variants: ki-\nnetic, genetic, toxic, and microbic. Kinetic: physical trauma, car crash, hit on a bike.\nToxic: environmental toxins, such as lead poisoning. Genetic: genetic disorders like\ncystic fibrosis, you are born with it. Microbic: virus, bacteria, prions. This is where\ntreatment can be symptomatic. This is where the miracles of medicine are. If you\nhave got a genetic disorder that is making you sick, you need a doctor. If you have\nbeen poisoned, you need a doctor. If you caught a nasty virus or a flesh-eating\nbacteria, you need a doctor. You do not need to go to the gym, and you do not need\nburpees. Doctors are like lifeguards; CrossFit trainers are like swim coaches. When\nyou are drowning, you do not need a swim coach. You needed one, and you did not\nget one. What you need is a lifeguard. We will teach people how to swim, and when\nthey do not pay attention, and they go under, the doctors take care of it.\nAccidents are largely stuff you can do nothing about, but there is one exception. Be\nfit. Kinetic: We hear stories from war of CrossFit athletes who survive things that\npeople have not survived previously. Toxicity: Someone who is fitter is more likely\nto survive the same poisoning than someone who is not. Genetic: There are genes\nyou have inherited that will or will not express because of your behavior through\ndiet and exercise. Microbic: Who is most vulnerable to viral pneumonia? The frail,\nthe feeble. So fitness offers a protection here.\nBut assume there is no protection from fitness because what you need in terms\nof preventing accidents largely is luck. Luck\u2014there is no \u201cgood luck\u201d versus \u201cbad\nluck\u201d\u2014looks like not having these things happen to you. Seventy percent of what"}

We have hacked health. Here is the magic formula for you:\nFitness + Luck (bad) = Health.\nIt is the part you can do something about plus the part you can do nothing about\nthat sums to your outcome. So make the most out of fitness and you will not be\npart of the seven out of 10 who die unnecessarily due to lifestyle. In the end, chron-\nic disease is a deficiency syndrome. It is sedentation with malnutrition.\nThe cost of chronic disease is such that U.S. medical expenditure is now about\n$4 trillion a year. In 2008, Pricewaterhousecoopers estimated that roughly half of\nall U.S. medical expenditure was wasted on unnecessary procedures, administra-\ntive inefficiencies, treatment of preventable conditions and so on. Add in fraud\nand abuse and we are wasting well more than a trillion dollars. We also know 86\npercent of overall health-care spending goes to treating the chronically diseased\nineffectively. Of the remaining 14 percent, half goes to the stuff that medicine can\nactually do something about. That means seven percent of health-care spending\nis not wasted. The amount spent on chronic disease is a waste.\nWhat CrossFit trainers are providing is non-medical health care. When doctors\ntreat those affected by accidents (the 30 percent), that is medical health care. If\nyou are confused about the two, it is easy to distinguish by methods and tools. If\nsomeone is cut open, given radiation, prescribed pills, injected with syringes, it is\nmedicine. It is treatment by a doctor.\nOn our side, it looks like CrossFit. We have rings, dumbbells, pull-up bars, our own\nbodies\u2014and the prescription is universal. It is not to treat disease. It does not mat-\nter where you fall on this continuum: You get put on the same program. If the pre-\nscription is universal, it cannot be medicine.

{"67": "TYPICAL CROSSFIT BLOCK PRESCRIPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS\nTo best understand the Zone Diet, CrossFit athletes should read Dr. Barry Sears\u2019\nbook \u201cEnter the Zone.\u201d This article gives more information regarding block pre-\nscriptions and fat adjustments for CrossFit athletes.\nThe chart based on sex and body type in the article \u201cZone Meal Plans\u201d is perfect\nfor those who want to start the Zone Diet. If the athlete chooses the wrong block\nsize and does not obtain the desired results, the plan can be modified after a few\nweeks. Errors in block selection might slow progress, but initial errors are offset by\nthe huge value in starting a practice of weighing and measuring intake.\nSears details a more precise method to calculate one\u2019s block prescription in \u201cEnter\nthe Zone.\u201d It is:\nZone block prescription = lean body mass (lb.) x activity level (g/lb. of lean\nbody mass) / 7 (g protein/block)\nThe activity level ranges on a scale of 0-1. For those who work out several days a\nweek and do not have a labor-intensive job, the activity level should be 0.7 (most\nCrossFit athletes). By dividing 0.7 by 7 g in the equation, this simplifies to a Zone\nblock prescription that is 10 percent of his or her lean mass.\nThe activity factor should increase if the athlete does CrossFit two or more times a\nday, trains for another sport in addition to CrossFit, or holds a strenuous daily job\n(e.g., construction, farming, etc., and potentially coaching, if on one\u2019s feet all day).\nAlthough CrossFit workouts are relatively intense, they are not long in duration.\nAn individual does not need to increase the activity level value based on intensity\nalone; activity volume determines activity factor.\nSAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE ZONE BLOCK PRESCRIPTION\nSuppose an athlete is 185 lb. (84 kg) with 16 percent body fat. He does CrossFit five\ndays per week and works in a typical office environment. A sample calculation of"}
{"68": "TABLE 1. MACRONUTRIENT AND CALORIE COMPOSITION\nFOR 15 BLOCKS A DAY\nProtein 15 blocks x 7 g = 105 g (420 calories)\nCarbohydrate 15 blocks x 9 g = 135 g (540 calories)\nFat 15 blocks x 3 g = 45 g (405 calories)\nTotal Calories = 1,365\nNote the total calories presented here are underestimated due to hidden calories.\nMost foods are classified by a single macronutrient, despite the presence of some\nother macronutrients (e.g., nuts are classified as a fat but have some protein and\ncarbohydrate calories). These less predominant macronutrients for each source\nare not included in the total calorie calculations.\nThis athlete could also choose to round up to 16 blocks, particularly if he or she is\nmore likely to have compliance issues. The Zone prescription is a calorie-restrictive\ndiet and can be especially difficult for new adopters. When one\u2019s calculation has a\ndecimal value, rounding up to the next whole block might result in slower progress\nbut produce better long-term compliance. Once the athlete has become accus-\ntomed to the diet, then the total blocks can be rounded down to 15, particularly if\ndesired body composition has not been achieved.\nINCREASING FAT INTAKE\nThe caloric restriction leans out the athlete while providing enough protein and\ncarbohydrate for typical CrossFit activity levels. However, the athlete can become\ntoo lean. The athlete is considered \u201ctoo lean\u201d when performance decreases in\ncombination with continued weight loss. \u201cToo lean\u201d should not be based on body\nweight or appearance alone. When a loss of mass coincides with a drop in perfor-\nmance, the athlete needs to add calories to the diet. This can be accomplished by\ndoubling the fat intake (Table 2)."}

{"70": "SUPPLEMENTATION\nWhole, unprocessed foods are the best source of both macronutrients and micro-\nnutrients in terms of composition, variety, and density, such that supplementation\nis generally not recommended. We contend that eating a diet composed of known\nquantities and of high-quality whole foods is the most important aspect of nutri-\ntion for improved performance and health. Not only are supplements generally\npoorer nutrient sources, but they are also an unnecessary focus for someone not\nfollowing our basic diet plan of weighed and measured meat and vegetables, etc.\nHowever, we find one supplement beneficial enough to make a blanket recom-\nmendation: fish oil. Fish oil provides omega-3 fatty acids, which are a type of poly-\nunsaturated fat.\nPhysiological fats are known as triglycerides in biological terms; they are composed\nof a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached (Figure 1). The attached fatty\nacids are mixtures of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats. Al-\nthough one fatty acid is prominent in each food, all three are represented to some\ndegree. Figure 2 provides a summary of the types of fat and example food sources.\nThe two types of polyunsaturated fats found most frequently in foods are ome-\nga-3 and omega-6 fats. Classifying a fatty acid as omega-3 versus omega-6 is\ndependent on chemical structure. Polyunsaturated fats are sources of the two\nessential fatty acids, meaning they must be obtained from the diet. They are al-\npha-linolenic acid (ALA) (an omega-3) and linoleic acid (LA) (an omega-6). Ome-\nga-3 fats are known as \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d fats, and omega-6 fats are known as\n\u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d fats based on their physiological functions. Both are needed\nin relatively equal quantities."}
{"71": "Figure 2. Summary of Fatty Acids and Example Food Sources."}
{"72": "Fish-oil supplementation improves the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids\nand reduces the inflammatory responses in the body. Fish oil provides two types\nof omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid\n(DHA), the form of omega-3 fats preferred by the brain and body. The body can\nconvert ALA to EPA and DHA, but the conversion process is inefficient. Some prac-\ntitioners have recommended a combined daily intake on the order of 3 grams of\nEPA and DHA for an otherwise healthy individual, although the exact amount is\ndictated by one\u2019s total omega-6 intake. Each brand of fish oil has a different con-\ncentration of EPA and DHA per serving as indicated on the label. Individuals might\nhave to take multiple servings to get 3 grams of EPA and DHA, as brands might\ninclude omega-3s that are neither EPA nor DHA (e.g., ALA). Flax seed or oil is not an\nappropriate supplement for omega-3s. Flax is a good source of ALA, but because\nof the poor conversion to EPA and DHA, it is not recommended. If the individual is\nvegan, DHA can be obtained with algae oil.\nResearch has indicated positive health benefits by supplementing with fish oil.\nOmega-3 fats help increase the fluidity of cell membranes, and research has in-\ndicated supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular function,\nnervous-system function, immune health, memory, and mood issues. Omega 3s\nalso function as an anti-coagulant, so military personnel should consider remov-\ning fish oil supplements from their diet a couple of weeks prior to deployment.\nIt might also be appropriate for those with an upcoming surgery to stop taking\nfish oil two weeks from that date. These individuals should talk with their doctor\nregarding these circumstances.\nIt is possible to avoid omega-3 supplementation depending on food intake, al-\nthough the individual needs to be fastidious with his or her diet. This could be\naccomplished by avoidance of all vegetable oils (which are used at most every\nrestaurant), and nuts and seeds. Meat would have to be grass-fed and eggs pas-\nture-raised, and wild-caught fish should be consumed a few times a week. Be-\ncause this is not practical for many people, supplementation is effective.\nBesides the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3s in the diet, the total amount of poly-"}

There are other factors that\nwill ultimately overshadow any disadvantages inherent in the potentially less ef-\nfective regimen, such as convenience, attitude, exercise selection, and pacing.\nFor the remainder of this article the three-day cycle is the one in discussion, but\nmost of the analysis and discussion applies perfectly to the five-day cycle.\nELEMENTS BY MODALITY\nLooking at the Template Macro View (Table 1) it can readily be seen that the tem-\nplate is based on the rotation of three distinct modalities: monostructural meta-\nbolic conditioning (M), gymnastics (G), and weightlifting (W). The monostructural\nmetabolic conditioning activities are commonly referred to as \u201ccardio,\u201d the pur-\npose of which is primarily to improve cardiorespiratory capacity and stamina.\nThey are repetitive, cyclical movements that could be sustained for long periods\nof time. The gymnastics modality comprises body-weight exercises/elements or\ncalisthenics, and its primary purpose is to improve body control by improving\nneurological components such as coordination, balance, agility, and accuracy, and\nto improve functional upper-body capacity and trunk strength. The weightlifting\nmodality comprises the most important weight-training basics, Olympic lifts and\npowerlifting, where the aim is primarily to increase strength, power, and hip/leg\ncapacity. This category includes any exercise with the addition of an external load.\nTable 2 gives the common exercises used by our program, separated by modality,\nin fleshing out the routines.\nFor metabolic conditioning the exercises are run, bike, row, and jump rope. The\ngymnastics modality includes air squats, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, handstand\npush-ups, rope climbs, muscle-ups, presses to handstands, back/hip extensions,\nsit-ups, and jumps (vertical, box, broad, etc.). The weightlifting modality includes\nTABLE 2. EXERCISES BY MODALITY"}
{"76": "deadlifts, cleans, presses, snatches, clean and jerks, medicine-ball drills and\nthrows, and kettlebell swings.\nThe elements, or exercises, chosen for each modality were selected for their\nfunctionality, neuroendocrine response, and overall capacity to dramatically and\nbroadly impact the human body.\nWORKOUT STRUCTURE\nThe workout structure varies by the inclusion of one, two, or three modalities for\neach day (Table 3). Days 1, 5, and 9 are each single-modality workouts whereas days\n2, 6, and 10 include two modalities each (couplets), and finally, days 3, 7, and 11 use\nthree modalities each (triplets). In every case each modality is represented by a\nsingle exercise or element; i.e., each M, W, and G represents a single exercise from\nmetabolic conditioning, weightlifting, and gymnastics modalities respectively.\nWhen the workout includes a single exercise (days 1, 5, and 9) the focus is on a\nsingle exercise or effort. When the element is the single \u201cM\u201d (day 1) the workout is\na single effort and is typically a long, slow, distance effort. When the modality is a\nsingle \u201cG\u201d (day 5) the workout is practice of a single skill, and typically this skill is\nsufficiently complex to require great practice but might not be yet suitable for in-\nclusion in a timed workout because performance is not yet adequate for efficient\ninclusion. When the modality is the single \u201cW\u201d (day 9) the workout is a single lift and\ntypically performed at high weight and low repetition. It is worth repeating that the\nfocus on days 1, 5, and 9 is single efforts of \u201ccardio\u201d at long distance; improving\nhigh-skill, more complex gymnastics movements; and single/low-rep heavy\nweightlifting basics, respectively. This is not the day to work sprints, pull-ups, or\nhigh-repetition clean and jerks \u2014the other days would be more appropriate.\nTABLE 3.

{"79": "SCALING CROSSFIT\nCrossFit workouts, and especially those on CrossFit.com, are designed to chal-\nlenge even the most advanced athlete. Many athletes need to \u201cscale\u201d (i.e., modify)\nthe workouts for the safest implementation of the program. Finding a CrossFit\naffiliate is one way to receive proper coaching and guidance through this pro-\ncess. In absence of an experienced trainer, this article presents some basic\nconcepts for scaling workouts particularly for beginners. Scaling for other pop-\nulations (e.g., advanced or injured athletes) is discussed in greater detail at the\nLevel 2 Certificate Course, as well as in the Online Scaling Course.\nAthletes will need to scale workouts for variable lengths of time. One\u2019s athletic\nbackground, as well as his or her current health and fitness capacity, dictates how\nlong scaling is necessary. The methodology presented here can be used indefi-\nnitely, but a month is the minimum period for which significant scaling should be\napplied. This introductory period serves two purposes: 1) it develops competency\nof movements used in CrossFit; and 2) it appropriately exposes the athlete to grad-\nual increases in intensity and volume.\nMECHANICS AND CONSISTENCY FIRST\nCrossFit\u2019s charter for creating the most optimal balance of safety, efficacy, and\nefficiency is: mechanics, consistency, then\u2014and only then\u2014intensity. The initial\nexposure to CrossFit is when movement mechanics should be prioritized over in-\ntensity. And for some, just practicing the movements will be intense. It is impera-\ntive that the movements can be performed correctly and consistently before load\nand speed are added. While intensity is an important part of the CrossFit program,\nit is added after movement proficiency is established. Ignoring this order increas-\nes the risk for injury and potentially blunts long-term progress, especially if poor\nmechanics are combined with load.\nSCALING EFFECTIVELY: PRESERVE THE STIMULUS\nWhen scaling workouts, the main principle to follow is \u201cpreserve the stimulus.\u201d"}
{"80": "Intensity and Volume\nTwo factors need to be scaled for every beginner: 1) intensity; and 2) volume. A\nprudent method for beginners is reducing intensity and/or volume by half for at\nleast two weeks. Depending on how the athlete progresses, volume and intensity\ncan be gradually increased in the following weeks, months, and years.\nIntensity refers to the amount of power an athlete generates. Intensity may be\nmodified in three ways: 1) load; 2) speed; and/or 3) volume.\nLoad is the variable to scale first; scaling the load is an easy way to preserve the\nstimulus relative to an athlete\u2019s capacity. Load is also the most common variable\nmodified after the beginner period. Especially for a conditioning workout, the ath-\nlete should use a load that ensures he or she is able to complete the first set or\nround without compromising form or reaching muscular failure. Determining ap-\npropriate loads for newer athletes requires some estimation, and scaling will not\nalways be perfect. Often, loads for newer athletes will be less than 50 percent\nof the prescribed load, especially if an athlete is new to lifting weights. Coaches\nshould err on the side of scaling too much rather than not enough, particularly for\nnewer athletes.\nSpeed tends to be more self-modulated due to the athlete\u2019s fitness level, although\na coach can modulate speed based on the mechanics demonstrated. A coach\nmight have to slow an athlete down to achieve the correct mechanics. Similarly,\ncoaches might have to encourage an athlete who is moving well to move faster,\nthough this is less common when working with beginners (see \u201cTechnique\u201d article).\nVolume is the total amount of work accomplished by the athlete. Depending on\nthe workout, volume can be lowered by reducing: 1) time; 2) reps/rounds; and/or\n3) distance.\nNewer CrossFit athletes might attempt to struggle through a workout where\nthe volume of repetitions (or load, above) is beyond their current capacity. For\nexample, an advanced CrossFit athlete might complete Fran in 2 minutes. That"}
{"81": "Movements\nWhen a movement cannot be performed at all, it can be substituted. CrossFit\nsuggests modifying this variable last because avoiding a movement prevents an\nindividual from developing proficiency in it. An athlete or trainer should first try re-\nducing the load before substituting the movement. If the workout calls for snatch-\nes at 95 lb., for example, it is generally preferable that the athlete performs the\nsnatches with a PVC pipe instead of substituting 95-lb. overhead squats.\nComplete movement substitutions should be considered when a physical limita-\ntion or injury is present, or when the load cannot be reduced. When selecting a\nsubstitute movement, trainers should try to preserve the original movement\u2019s\nfunction and range of motion as best they can. When determining movement sub-\nstitutions consider:\n1) Whether the movement is primarily driven by the lower body or\nupper body.\n2) The movement function (e.g., push versus pull).\n3) The range of motion used by the movement (specifically of the hips,\nknees, and ankles).\n4) The plane of movement.\nParticularly in the case of injury, a complete movement replacement might be nec-\nessary. Consideration of these variables can help trainers select a movement sub-\nstitution or replacement that is as similar as possible to the prescribed movement.\nA SAMPLE WEEK OF SCALING\nThis section outlines five typical CrossFit workouts. For each Workout of the Day\n(WOD), scaled workouts are presented with modifications to volume, load, and\nmovements. Some of the rationale for the options is also described. These scaled\nworkouts should be considered but three examples of the many options available.\nThey do not take the place of scaled workouts created by an experienced trainer\nwho is relying on intuition and detailed knowledge of a specific athlete."}

For\nexample, a 1-repetition-maximum snatch day may be changed to 3 repetitions.\nIn rare cases, the range of motion may be shortened until the mechanics are correct.

A medicine ball is\nparticularly useful for the newer athlete.\nThe muscle-up will need to be scaled, and this is best accomplished with upper-body pulling and\npushing movements, or even a banded version of the full movement itself.\nChanging the rep scheme can be useful when the modification significantly challenges the\nindividual\u2019s strength stamina. Doing so will allow the individual to achieve almost the same volume\nwhile he or she develops new skills and/or is exposed to heavier elements.\nCONCLUSION\nAthletes and their trainers should focus on movement proficiency before adding\nspeed and load. Workouts should be scaled significantly for at least a month, par-\nticularly with regard to intensity and volume. The period of scaling workouts\u2014\nespecially load\u2014might continue for months and years as the athlete develops\nthe requisite capacities.

{"108": "THE AIR SQUAT\nAll our athletes begin their squatting with the \u201cair squat\u201d; that is, without any\nweight other than body weight. As a matter of terminology, when we refer to the\n\u201csquat\u201d we are talking about an unladen, body-weight-only squat. When we wish\nto refer to a weighted squat we will use the term back squat, overhead squat, or\nfront squat, referring to those distinct weighted squats. Training with the front,\nback, and overhead squats before the weightless variant has been mastered re-\ntards athletic potential and compromises safety and efficacy.\nWhen has the squat been mastered? This is a good question. It is fair to say that\nthe squat is mastered when both technique and performance are superior. This\nsuggests that none of the points of performance are deficient and fast multiple\nreps are possible. Our favorite standard for fast multiple reps would be the Ta-\nbata squat (20 seconds on/10 seconds off repeated 8 times) with the weakest of\neight intervals being between 18 and 20 reps. Do not misunderstand \u2014we are\nlooking for 18-20 perfect squats in 20 seconds, rest for 10, and repeat seven\nmore times for a total of eight intervals.\nThe most common faults to look for are surrendering of the lumbar curve at the\nbottom, not breaking the parallel plane with the hips, slouching in the chest and\nshoulders, lifting the heels, and not fully extending the hip at the top (Figure 1).\nDo not even think about weighted squats until none of these faults belong to you.\nA relatively small angle of hip extension, while indicative of a beginner\u2019s or weak\nsquat and caused by weak hips extensors, is not strictly considered a fault as\nlong as the lumbar spine is neutral.\nCAUSES OF A BAD SQUAT\n1) Weak glute/hamstring. The glutes and hams are responsible for powerful\nhip extension, which is the key to the athletic performance universe.\n2) Poor engagement, weak control, and no awareness of glute and\nhamstring. The road to powerful, effective hip extension is a three-to-\nfive-year odyssey for most athletes."}

Additionally, the ad-\nvanced elements of the progression, the push press and jerk, train for and devel-\nop power and speed. Power and speed are \u201cking\u201d in sport performance.

{"124": "SUMMARY\nFrom shoulder press to push jerk the movements become increasingly more ath-\nletic, functional, and suited to heavier loads. The progression also increasingly\nrelies on the power zone. In the shoulder press, the power zone is used for stabi-\nlization only. In the push press the power zone provides not only stability but also\nthe primary impetus in both the dip and drive. In the push jerk the power zone is\ncalled on for the dip, drive, second dip, and squat. The role of the hip is increased\nin each exercise.\nWith the push press you will be able to drive overhead as much as 30 percent more\nweight than with the shoulder press. The push jerk will allow you to drive as much\nas 30 percent more overhead than you would with the push press.\nIn effect the hip is increasingly recruited through the progression of lifts to assist\nthe arms and shoulders in raising loads overhead. After mastering the push jerk\nyou will find that it will unconsciously displace the push press as your method of\nchoice when going overhead.\nThe second dip on the push jerk will become lower and lower as you both master\nthe technique and increase the load. At some point in your development, the loads\nwill become so substantial that the upper body cannot contribute but a fraction\nto the movement, at which point the catch becomes very low and an increasing\namount of the lift is accomplished by the overhead squat.\nOn both the push press and jerk, the \u201cdip\u201d is critical to the entire movement. The\nstomach is held very tightly and the resultant turnaround from dip to drive is sud-\nden, explosive, and violent.\nTRY THESE\n1) Start with 95 lb. and push press or push jerk 15 straight repetitions, rest\n30 seconds, and repeat for total of 5 sets of 15 repetitions each. Go up\nin weight only when you can complete all 5 sets with only 30 seconds of\nrest between each and do not pause in any set."}

{"133": "THE GLUTE-HAM DEVELOPER (GHD)\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s March 18, 2007, L1 lecture in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nOur definition of core strength is midline stabilization. In profile, there is a ref-\nerence line that trisects the spine and bisects the pelvis. Midline stabilization is\nthe ability to maintain rigidity, stability, and a lack of deflection about that line\n(Figure 1). This translates to improved efficiency and performance and greater\npower output.\nIt is critical to the deadlift, to the laden squat, to the shoulder press, and to any\nsport. In a swimmer\u2019s stroke\u2014when the left leg kicks and right arm pulls\u2014if the\ntorso deviates to one side, you lose energy. Energy is lost in its deflection, wheth-\ner throwing a punch, riding a bicycle, or squatting. The abdominals, with the hip\nflexors, control one side of the torso, with the hip extensors and erectors involved\non the other side.\nHowever, what we have in modern physical culture is an excessive awareness\nand focus on the anterior and not on the posterior. As a culture of athletes and\nnon-athletes alike, we are unfortunately frontally fixated. Pecs\u2014what about the\nrhomboids? Abs\u2014what about the erectors? Quads\u2014what about the glute-ham-\nstring? And for the best of functional movement\u2014punch, jump, throw, run\u2014the\nimpetus comes out of the posterior.\nWe see communities where there is a very deliberate and concerted effort to min-\nimize hip-flexor involvement in exercise. And yet, by insertion and origin, by me-\nchanical position and advantage, and just kinematically, the hip flexors, have\nseveral times the contraction capacity that is estimated of the abdominals. All of it:\nhip extensors, hip flexors, trunk flexors, and ex-\ntensors are essential to midline stabilization. The\nabdominals are just one part of the story.\nFor core strength (midline stabilization), we are"}

There is no trunk-extension work, no hip-extension\nwork, and hip flexion is deliberately limited. Some of these communities also have\nproblems with chronic back injury, which comes at no surprise. If there is anything\nto \u201cmuscle balance,\u201d it makes sense. In how many communities are they doing an\nequal number of deadlifts and squats to their sit-ups? Most of the military/law-en-\nforcement PT is completely devoid of full-range-of-motion hip extension. Rucking,\nrunning, jumping jacks\u2014all will not do it. The run, pull-up, sit-up, push-up, lath-\ner-rinse-repeat PT has no real good core movement. The crunch does not count.\nWhile a cumbersome and space-taking piece of gear, the GHD has been essential\nto our work. We have four of them in 2,500 square feet, so one every 600 feet.\nWe use the GHD for four exercises to heighten awareness and develop capacity\nat midline stabilization. The punchline to the story is that static contractions that\nstabilize the midsection are the most important and functional (powerful) muscu-\nlar contractions in that region. Static contractions for midline stabilization are the\nbest ab exercises known. No amount of crunches are ever going to get you to the\nsame end point as the L-sit, overhead squat, deadlift, etc.\nWhat we suspect is that if you could sequentially fire the abs with the same force\nin any kind of dynamic pattern, you would have the ability to seriously injure your\nspine. If you could ever crunch with the same force that you can stabilize, you\nwould be able to break your back at will. We have come hardwired unable to do\nthat\u2014that is my guess.\nThe movements are presented in the order in which they should be developed in\na client. The first thing is a simple hip extension: articulate at the hip only, maintain-\ning the distance from xiphoid process to pubic bone. There is no shortening of the\ntrunk. There is no trunk flexion,\njust hip extension and flexion\nwhile maintaining midline sta-\nbilization. The erectors are be-\ning used statically, and the"}

Then the back extends sequentially along the spine from \u201csouth\nto north\u201d (Figure 5).\nThis movement does a lot for a coach. It heightens a neurological awareness. It\nallows me to introduce some essential vernacular to the client. If we do not have\ncues that allow me to talk about hip flexion, trunk flexion, hip extension, trunk ex-\ntension, I am fairly worthless with a client. Very early, get clients to know terms. Be\nable to call it out and get the response you need.\nThis movement demonstrates tremendous control. There is hip flexion, hip ex-\ntension, trunk flexion and trunk extension in a combo \u201csnake\u201d move. Using those\nmuscles is essential for midline stabilization and working the posterior.\nThe fourth movement on the GHD is a sit-up but involves no trunk flexion. For the\nGHD sit-up, the pad is set so that the pelvis is free, and the athlete descends back\nto touch the ground and then comes back to seated. More than a few exercise\nphysiologists and certified trainers have observed that this movement is pure hip\nflexion and consequently asserted \u201cthere\u2019s no abs in that.\u201d\nBut what the abs are doing in this exercise is midline stabilization.\nBefore having clients perform the GHD sit-up, ensure they have demonstrated ca-\npacity in the hip extension, back extension, and hip-and-back extension. Even still,\ntheir first GHD sit-ups should be performed in a shortened range of motion, with\nthe trainer spotting behind them (Figure 6). That might be it for the first dose. Once\nthey come back and you can determine the effect from that dose, increase the\nrange of motion and volume as their capacity allows.\nTo perform a GHD sit-up, there is some leg flexion in the descent. Then, the leg\nextends dramatically and pulls the athlete to seated (Figure 7). Conversely, if the\nathlete does not extend the leg to come to seated, the primary movers are the hip"}
{"142": "The force with which an athlete comes up is amazing. Rather than being pulled\nfrom the psoas alone, which is a fairly dysfunctional kind of pull, the athlete uses\nthe full complement of hip-flexor musculature. Any time you are using a fraction of\nthe primary movers responsible for that articulation, it is not natural, not function-\nal, and contrary to nature. Not extending the leg can also be a little irritating to the\nlow back due to this shearing force on the lumbar spine. Performed correctly, the\nmovement is not irritating to the low back. Straightening that leg enables profound\nmusculature to lift from the pelvis.\nThere are people who have this irritation in the spine from a shear force. If you can\nteach them to extend the legs to work the full complement of hip flexors, we will\nmove the margins where this irritation occurs from 3 reps to 4 reps to 10 reps and\nso on. That is rehabilitation. That is neuromuscular re-education.\nThere is an adjunct movement to GHD sit-up in which the athlete is dynamic in the\ntrunk and static in the hip. It is the AbMat sit-up, where we deliberately take the\nhip flexors out of the equation and work the torso dynamically. The hip flexors are\nworking statically or possibly to no significant degree.\nTo do this, the hip flexors need to be removed from the line of action. The fat part\nof the AbMat goes toward the glutes, and the athlete puts the bottom of his or her\nsoles together with the knees butterflied. This positioning makes the hip flexors\ntangential to the line of action; i.e., they cannot do any productive work. This is\ndone deliberately. Then the athlete slowly and under control comes to seated by\ncontracting the abdominals. This is a very dynamic bit of trunk flexion and the hip\nflexors are removed (Figure 8).\nAs the athlete fails, adduct and extend the legs to some degree. This creates more\npurchase for the hip flexors and brings them into the line of action. This allows the\nathlete to modulate the assistance and keep each rep focused on the midsection.\nIf reps are performed slowly and deliberately, most athletes will fail a sit-up with-\nout an AbMat. The failure is not necessarily a neuromuscular failure. It is not"}

But that lum-\nbar region is fairly inflexible, and all that range of motion that is available moves\none from spinally extended through to neutral. There is no more shortening or\nflexion to it; it is not enough to sit up.\nWithout the AbMat, the sit-up is a biphasic movement. While I have solid contact,\nI use upper rectus and create enough momentum to throw the load to the hip\nflexors, where I have more connection. This means that the full rectus has little\nstimulus\u2014it is pulling me from spinally extended through to neutral, but absent\nof any load. The upper rectus is worked where there is a fulcrum, so the back flat-\ntens, but it is the hip flexors that pull me to seated. There is no amount of sit-ups\nyou can do on the ground that is ever going to work you from pubic bone to about\n3 or 4 inches above the belly button. The AbMat moves the athlete from spinally\nextended through to neutral in the lumbar spine against a load.\nHow big would your bench press get if you only pushed air? You would get as\nstrong as your abs will with a ground-based sit-up. With or without the pad, there\nis the same contraction and range of motion in the midsection. Without the pad,\nthe fibers shortened but there was no load and no real work completed. With the\npad, they got the same motion but under a load, and it produced fruitful work.\nThe two sit-ups, GHD and AbMat, complement each other beautifully. One is dy-\nnamic in the hips and static in the trunk; the other is dynamic in the trunk and stat-\nic in the hip. In conjunction with the L-sit (static in the trunk and hip), they develop\na formidable capacity in the midline."}

Rhabdo-\nmyolysis (often simply referred to as \u201crhabdo\u201d) is a medical condition that might\narise from breakdown of muscle tissue and release of the muscle cells\u2019 contents\ninto the bloodstream. This process can damage the kidneys and can lead to renal\nfailure or death in rare cases. Rhabdo is diagnosed when a patient with an appro-\npriate history has an elevated level of creatine kinase, also known as CK or CPK.\nCPK is easier to measure in the blood than myoglobin and is generally used as a\nmarker for rhabdo, even though it is the myoglobin that does the damage.\nTreatment consists of generous amounts of intravenous (IV) fluids to dilute and\nflush the myoglobin through the kidneys. In the worst cases, patients might need\ndialysis while the kidneys recover. Death, though rare, can result when kidney fail-\nure causes imbalances in the usual electrolytes, which can cause cardiac arrhyth-\nmias. Most patients make a complete recovery after being rehydrated with IV fluids\nover anywhere from several hours to a week or so, depending on the severity.\nThere are a few ways a CrossFit trainer can protect athletes from rhabdomyolysis:\n\u2022 Follow the charter of mechanics, consistency, intensity.\n\u2022 Know the movements that have a higher rate of rhabdomyolysis incidence\n(those that prolong the eccentric contraction), and be mindful of the total"}
{"154": "focus on using modest loads, reducing volume and coaching the athlete on tech-\nnique. At affiliates where there are \u201celements\u201d or \u201con-ramp\u201d classes that last a\ncouple of weeks, athletes should still be heavily scaled beyond this introductory\nperiod to ensure adequate time to acclimate to CrossFit training. If there are no\nseparate classes for beginners, treat the workouts as technique sessions for new-\ner athletes\u2013focus on their mechanics rather than speed or load. There is no set\nprotocol for how quickly to increase intensity, but it is wise to err on the side of\ncaution and work toward long-term fitness. Multiple months at scaled loads and\nvolumes are well within a normal timeframe for even the best athletes, with gradu-\nal increases in intensity implemented after that. Trainers need to frequently check\nin with athletes to determine how the previous dose of exercise affected them.\nAlthough intensity is a significant part of CrossFit, each athlete has his or her entire\nlife to continue to improve fitness and tolerance for intensity.\nThe second way to mitigate the risk of rhabdomyolysis is to know the movements\nassociated with a higher rate of incidence. Beginner athletes should keep \u201cnega-\ntives\u201d (movements which prolong the eccentric phase) to a minimum. Although\nnegatives can be an effective way to increase strength, they should not be used\nin high volumes with beginners. Athletes may increase the volume of negatives\ngradually over time.\nWhile the eccentric phase of movements cannot and should not be avoided, there\nare movements in which people are more likely to prolong the eccentric phase. In\nCrossFit, these tend to be jumping pull-ups and full-range-of-motion glute-ham de-\nveloper (GHD) sit-ups. In the jumping pull-up, the athlete should not prolong the\ndescent but should instead immediately drop to an extended-arm position once\nthe chin has cleared the bar, absorbing the impact with the legs. Similarly, in the\nfull-range-of-motion GHD sit-up, newer athletes should use fewer repetitions and\npotentially a shortened range of motion until capacity is developed. It is also prudent\nfor trainers to scale the number of repetitions and the range of motion for athletes\nwho do not routinely use GHD sit-ups regardless of their CrossFit experience. There\nare no exact rules for total volume, but beginners and new CrossFit athletes (and\neven advanced CrossFit athletes who have not been routinely using the GHD) should"}

Certain medications, in-\ncluding statins (cholesterol-lowering agents), increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis.\nSymptoms of rhabdomyolysis include severe generalized muscle pain, nausea\nand vomiting, abdominal cramping, and, in severe cases, dark-red or cola-colored\nurine. The discoloration of the urine comes from the muscle\u2019s myoglobin, which is\nthe same molecule that gives red meat its color. If these symptoms appear follow-\ning a workout (or at any time with regard to dark-red urine), the athlete should seek\nmedical attention immediately.\nThe athletes at highest risk seem to be those with a reasonable baseline level of\nfitness obtained through some non-CrossFit training, those who are returning to\nCrossFit after a layoff, or even experienced CrossFit athletes who reach volume\nor intensity significantly outside their established \u201cnorm.\u201d These athletes have\nsufficient muscle mass and conditioning to create enough intensity to hurt them-\nselves. Generally, the most deconditioned seem to be at less risk (but not zero). It\nis suspected they do not have enough muscle mass or the capacity to generate\nhigh levels of intensity. This being said, trainers must properly scale and focus on\nmechanics with every client regardless of current capacity.\nMINIMIZE EQUIPMENT- AND SPOTTING-RELATED INJURIES\nBeyond following the charter of mechanics, consistency, and intensity, affiliate\nowners can further minimize risk of injury within their gym. Very real risks exist\nfrom equipment condition, use, and arrangement, as well as from improper spot-\nting of athletes during movements.\nEquipment condition refers both to installation and day-to-day maintenance. In-\nstallation often applies to building pull-up rigs, hanging gymnastics rings, assem-\nbling a GHD, among other things. Professional assistance should be used when an"}
{"156": "regularly for integrity. Trainers must repair, replace, and discontinue use of faulty\nequipment immediately.\nArrangement refers to the layout of equipment and athletes during a class or\nworkout. Each athlete needs enough space to perform the movements, with an\nadditional buffer to account for the errant-moving equipment, missed attempts,\nand safe passage of coaches or other athletes. Under no circumstances should a\ntrainer permit extra equipment like bars, plates, boxes, etc. to be left lying around\nthe workout area. This equipment might trip athletes or cause a ricochet if other\nequipment lands on it.\nIt is also imperative for a trainer to prepare for falls during dynamic movements. It is\npossible that an athlete might lose his or her grip during a kip (pull-up or muscle-up).\nTrainers might encourage athletes to wrap their thumbs around any bar in an ef-\nfort to provide additional feedback to the athlete. This is not foolproof, however,\nand can sometimes be even less secure, particularly for athletes with small hands.\nWhatever the hand position chosen, it does not replace the need for the athlete to\ndevelop body awareness of when to end the movement if his or her grip is compro-\nmised (wrapping thumbs is always recommended for barbell and ring movements\nto help provide better balance and control, especially in higher-risk scenarios such\nas a bench press or muscle-up). Boxes and racks should not be beneath, behind or\ndirectly in front of these athletes. Adjustable rings should be lowered to the appro-\npriate height. Where assistance boxes are necessary, they are best placed to the side\nof the working athlete (and not in another athlete\u2019s way) to leave a clear path should\nan athlete leave the apparatus prematurely. A suggestion for trainers trying to man-\nage these risks is to do a \u201cdry run\u201d of the workout before it begins: check the working\nspace for each athlete for each of the proposed movements. This can be as simple as\norganizing the class to rotate stations on the trainer\u2019s call and perform a quick walk-\nthrough to check spacing and arrangement. Trainers can then instruct participants\nto move to the same spot during the workout to ensure safety.\nAthletes also need instruction regarding how to bail safely from lifts and how to\nspot other athletes where appropriate. In most weightlifting movements, the ath-"}
{"157": "can be successful (e.g., handstands). The spotter may be to the rear of the athlete\nif the risk of getting hit is low (e.g., ring support, GHD sit-up), but often a position\nbeside the athlete is best (e.g., handstand).\nTrainers need to be sure equipment is cleaned regularly to reduce the chance of\ninfection, and proper disinfectants and sterilizers, with clean cloths, should be\nstaged near the gym floor to clean blood off bars immediately. A blood-spill clean-\nup procedure can be found in the CrossFit Journal archives.\nMONITORING ATHLETES FOR CONDITIONS THAT NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION\nAlthough a trainer is primarily there to instruct and improve athlete movements,\nhe or she needs to monitor the level of exertion during the workout and ensure\nathlete health is protected. As CrossFit workouts use relatively high intensity, ath-\nletes are working at their physical and psychological tolerances. It is possible for\nathletes to push too hard, and confounding environmental factors might exacer-\nbate certain situations.\nExtreme temperature fluctuations, especially heat, can be problematic. Trainers\nshould be ready in unseasonably hot and humid weather with sufficient water, and\nthey should watch for common signs of overexertion (e.g., dizziness). Hot weather\nalso increases the potential risk for rhabdomyolysis (although some cases have\noccurred in cold climates), and trainers should encourage athletes to stay hydrated\n(with the caveat that they should not be excessively hydrated. Current mainstream\nliterature suggests rates of 1.2 L/hour, which are actually too high and can lead to\noverhydration). In the event of a potential heat stroke following a workout (e.g.,\nathlete demonstrates an altered mental state), a trainer should remove excess\nclothing from the athlete and then douse him or her with cool water before med-\nical attention arrives.\nWeather aside, other conditions might need medical attention. Symptoms such\nas numbness or chronic pain in joints and muscles should be referred to medical\nprofessionals. Medical attention is immediately necessary for any non-respon-\nsive athlete."}
{"158": "We advise against rehydration strategies that encourage consumption of fluids to\nprevent loss of body-weight during activity. Dehydration during physical activity is\na normal physiological process, and the thirst mechanism is sufficient in regulating\nhydration and serum sodium concentration during exercise.\nDrinking beyond thirst in an attempt to prevent body-weight loss during exercise\noffers no benefit to health or performance. It also presents a serious risk of ex-\nercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), a potentially deadly dilution of the body\u2019s\nserum sodium concentration. EAH is caused by overconsumption of fluid and can\nbe viewed as an iatrogenic condition due to the prevailing belief that exercising\nathletes should drink \u201cas much fluid as tolerable\u201d during training.\n\u201cFluid\u201d that can contribute to EAH includes electrolyte-enhanced sports drinks.\nContrary to popular belief, these commercial beverages do not reduce risk of hy-\nponatremia. Because of flavoring and sugar content, these drinks might present\ngreater risk for overconsumption of fluid than water alone, increasing the risk of\npotentially deadly EAH in athletes.\nSPECIAL POPULATIONS\nAny potential athlete with a medical condition needs to be cleared by a physician for\nexercise before a trainer recommends a fitness regimen. A medical-history form can\nbe a useful tool for a trainer to assess any potential issues, although trainers are also\nencouraged to ask questions regarding medical status and be aware of common\nmedical conditions that need clearance (e.g., diabetes, prescription medications).\nCommon special populations include pregnant athletes, and a trainer should still\nrequest medical clearance and guidelines from the physician once the condition is\nknown. The CrossFit Journal archive contains many resources regarding scaling for\npregnant athletes, such as the article \u201cPregnancy: A Practical Guide for Scaling.\u201d A\ntrainer should be especially aware of reducing the risk of potential falls in workouts\n(e.g., box jumps, rope climbs) and be observant for complaints of calf pain or swell-\ning, which can be signs of more serious issues."}

{"261": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nFOUNDATIONS OF EFFECTIVE TRAINING\nWhereas the Level 1 Certificate Course provides an introduction to functional movements and CrossFit methodol-\nogy, the Level 2 Course is focused on improving a trainer\u2019s ability to coach others.\nA trainer\u2019s ability to coach others rests on capacity in six different areas:\n\u2022 Teaching\n\u2022 Seeing\n\u2022 Correcting\n\u2022 Group Management\n\u2022 Presence and Attitude\n\u2022 Demonstration\nThe depth and breadth of a trainer\u2019s capacity in each area affects not only whether clients become more fit but also\nthe degree to which the clients become more fit. Effectiveness can be assessed by asking whether clients optimize\nwork capacity across broad time and modal domains (i.e., whether a client becomes as fit and healthy as possible)\nA newer trainer may have only rudimentary capacity in each area and clients still will see results because of the\ninherent benefits of performing constantly varied functional movements at high intensity. An effective trainer, on\nthe other hand, has the ability to safeguard health and improve performance for a client beyond what he or she\ncould do alone.\nAlthough these areas can be described and defined independently (below), there is a natural overlap among them in\na real-time coaching environment. A deficiency in any one area can inhibit a trainer\u2019s success. Even a weakness in one\narea relative to the others blunts the trainer\u2019s overall reach. For example, a trainer with tremendous knowledge and\ntechnical skill (teaching, seeing, and correcting) will still have difficulty retaining members if there is little persona\nconnection with them (presence and attitude).\nRegardless of a trainer\u2019s current level of proficiency, a commitment to improving each area is the hallmark of a\nsuccessful trainer. Similar to the athlete\u2019s path to refining and improving movement mechanics, a trainer must refine\ncoaching skills across a career to become great. Doing so develops virtuosity in coaching.\nTEACHING\nThe ability to effectively articulate and instruct the mechanics of each movement, including the ability to focus on major\npoints of performance before more subtle or nuanced ones. It also includes the ability to change instruction based on\nthe athlete\u2019s needs and capacity.\nTo teach functional movements, a trainer must first understand what defines proper mechanics and what may cause\npoor movement. A trainer must know ideal positions, but more frequently a trainer\u2019s job is to teach athletes how to\nimprove poor positions and movement patterns.\nKnowledge in fitness-related areas\nBeyond movement mechanics, trainers can also instruct clients in other areas that may improve their fitness. Greater\nknowledge in any field that overlaps with fitness\u2014such as anatomy and physiology, nutrition, or even expertise in"}
{"262": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\na certain sport\u2014can aid a trainer\u2019s teaching. The more athletically advanced the athlete, the greater the depth of\nknowledge needed for a trainer to produce additional fitness gains. Continued research, education, and practical\nexperience over the course of a career develop a breadth of knowledge applicable to any athlete, from beginner to elite.\nTeaching demands not only possessing knowledge but also the ability to impart it to others. Knowledge alone does\nnot make one an effective teacher. Successful teaching hinges on a trainer\u2019s ability to accurately convey as much of\nthat knowledge as possible to others.\nEffective communication\nTo convey knowledge effectively, a teacher must be able to change his or her communication style to meet the\ncapacity of the student, regardless of his or her background, ability, and learning style. This is why trainers are\nbest served by using different means of communication\u2014visual and verbal teaching, for example\u2014to aid learning.\nImplicit in the trainer-athlete dialogue is the trainer taking responsibility for when communication with the athlete\nbreaks down. It is the trainer\u2019s responsibility to guide and lead the athlete, and it is the athlete\u2019s responsibility to be\ncommitted to the process. However, if the athlete is clearly frustrated with the instruction, the trainer must change\nstrategies or communication style until the athlete succeeds.\nA trainer can also assess the effectiveness of teaching and communication by determining whether the athlete meets\nperformance expectations. If no one in a group moves to the level the trainer expects, he or she needs to reevaluate\nthe instruction. It is often not the athlete\u2019s fault. A good teacher can use effective communication to prevent a large\npercentage of problems from occurring. For example, it is often effective to break complex movements down into\na progression or logical teaching steps that allow the athlete to practice pieces that naturally build on one another.\nA teacher who shows an athlete a barbell clean, describes it in its entirety, and then asks the class to replicate it can\nexpect few (if any) to match the instruction. Conversely, using a progression\u2014such as that demonstrated for the\nmedicine-ball clean at the Level 1 Course\u2014will get more athletes to demonstrate the gross mechanics quickly. These\nprogressions can often help a trainer focus on seeing certain faults as well.\nTeaching as much as is necessary often means the teacher must reduce and simplify his or her body of knowledge\nto the one or two most salient points at that moment for that particular athlete. With fast-paced human movement,\nchange is often hampered by long and detailed explanations when simple, broad-brush instructions are more digest-\nible. This does not mean a trainer\u2019s knowledge of the system should be simple; it is the explanation that should be.\nA trainer can ask himself or herself, \u201cWhat is the one thing this athlete needs right now?\u201d The answer will change as\nprogress is made.\nseeing\nThe ability to distinguish good from poor movement mechanics and identify both gross and subtle faults whether the\nathlete is in motion or static.\nA trainer who can effectively assess the mechanical positions as sound or unsound throughout movement has\ncapacity in seeing. Seeing is the necessary first step for a trainer to bring about change in a client\u2019s mechanics, but it\nrests on one\u2019s teaching capacity (knowledge). Trainers must first know positions of best mechanical leverage, as well\nas the effect of varying anthropometrics on these positions. If a trainer does not know what to look for, he or she will\nnot see correctible issues."}
{"263": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nStatic faults\nThe trainer must also use visual-recognition skills throughout the repetition, whether the athlete is static or dynamic\nStatic positions are the points at which the athlete is not moving, even briefly. Static positions usually occur near\nthe end ranges of motion\u2014either in the starting, receiving, or finishing positions\u2014or when there is a brief pause or\ndecreased speed, often due to a change of direction. Static positions include the setup position for a deadlift or the\nbottom of a squat, for example. Correctly identifying faults is easier in static positions because these positions give\ntrainers more time for assessment.\nDynamic faults\nDynamic positions find the athlete moving between the static positions, often at high speed. Examples of faults\nseen in dynamic movements include not reaching full hip extension in the drive phase of a clean, pressing early in a\npush press, or initiating the squat with the knees. These dynamic faults are more difficult to identify because of the\ndecreased time for assessment. The trainer must also know when and where to see faults during the movement. For\nexample, a trainer needs to see that the athlete has the weight on the heels during the drive phase of a push jerk\nbut the trainer is also evaluating the trunk-to-femur relationship for hip extension, the bar path relative to the fronta\nplane, and a whole host of other relationships. Generally, a profile view of the athlete (offset by about 45 degrees)\nis the most useful view to assess the athlete\u2019s mechanics, but trainers should not be limited to using this view only.\nThe difficulty in seeing dynamic faults increases as:\n1. the athlete moves more quickly, and\n2. the faults become more subtle.\nYears of experience help a trainer effectively coach any level of athlete. New trainers may use a few methods to\ndevelop their ability to see faults, particularly dynamic faults. One method is to study film. Slow the movement down\nto a series of static frames. A trainer may choose to film his or her own athletes or simply watch footage available\non the internet. Replaying the footage in real time after observing the movement in a static series can help bridge\nthe gap between seeing static and dynamic positions. Another strategy for newer trainers is to methodically survey\nathletes for only one fault at a time. For example, when teaching athletes the push jerk, the trainer may choose to\nwatch only for hip extension during the first several repetitions. Then, the trainer may choose to watch and see if\nthe athletes drive through their heels. Over time, trainers can observe multiple faults simultaneously (e.g., lack of hip\nextension or not having the weight on the heels), but initially, trying to see everything often results in seeing nothing\nSimilarly, newer trainers generally find more success by watching one athlete at a time per repetition instead of\nscanning multiple athletes with every repetition.\nCorreCTing\nThe ability to facilitate better mechanics for an athlete using visual, verbal, and/or tactile cues. This includes the ability\nto triage (prioritize) faults in order of importance, which requires an understanding of how multiple faults are related.\nThe ability of a trainer to facilitate improved mechanics is dependent on capacities in teaching and seeing. Teaching\nreflects a trainer\u2019s knowledge of proper mechanics; seeing reflects a trainer\u2019s ability to discern these positions in rea\ntime. If capacity is limited in either, it follows that the trainer\u2019s capacity in correcting will also be weak.\nCorrecting mechanics results in both increased performance gains and decreased risk of injury. A trainer can expect\nto correct an athlete\u2019s mechanics forever; mechanics can be infinitely refined to create ever more efficient positions"}

CrossFit trainers should strive for excellent mechanics in their clients and avoid settling for\n\u201cOK\u201d movement. This means a trainer must be able to correct both gross and subtle deviations in all levels of athletes\nThey must set a high standard for good movement and be relentless in the constant pursuit of improvement.\nCorrecting hinges on the trainer\u2019s ability to:\n1. use successful cues,\n2. know multiple corrections for each fault,\n3. triage faulty movement, and\n4. balance critique with praise.\nCues\nAny cue that results in improved movement mechanics is successful and therefore a good cue. There are no specific\nformulas, formats, or rules to follow for cues, and their value is based on the result. A cue\u2019s primary function is to\nhelp the athlete execute perfect mechanics, not to perfectly describe the mechanics of the movement. For example\none may say \u201cweight in heels\u201d to help a person shift weight back and better achieve pressure across the foot (versus\non the toes). Generally, making cues short, specific, and actionable tends to result in a greater success rate. Short\nspecific, and actionable cues are useful because the trainer gives a single task for the athlete to complete. An example\nof this type of cue is, \u201cPush your knees out.\u201d It is short (four words), specific to a body part (knees), and also indicates\naction and/or direction (out). It is easy for the athlete to respond to a cue such as this, even when performing a com-\nplicated movement.\nIt is possible for a trainer to confuse cueing with fault identification. For example, pointing out the fault that is pres-\nent\u2014\u201cYour knees are caving in\u201d\u2014does not tell the athlete how to fix it. An experienced athlete may be able to make\nthe leap from hearing the identification of the fault to then fixing it, but this translation from fault identification to\nspecific direction is ultimately the trainer\u2019s responsibility.\nTrainers may also rely on more technical language in their cues (i.e., \u201cYou are losing your midline\u201d), which assumes the\nathlete has a significant amount of fitness-related knowledge. While such language may give the appearance of being\nmore technical (and perhaps represents an attempt to sound more intelligent), it is at best a vague verbal cue. Cues\nshould be kept to simple language that is easily understood by anyone. Non-specific language is also best avoided\nin cues. Something such as, \u201cGet tight!\u201d or \u201cChest!\u201d can be meaningless to the athlete, especially in the absence of\ninstruction on how to \u201cget tight\u201d or where and how to move the chest.\nA basic three-step process for developing short, specific, and actionable cues is:\n1. identify the fault,\n2. identify what is out of place (be specific: name the body part), and\n3. give direction to that body part.\nAs stated before, \u201cPush your knees out\u201d is a short, specific, and actionable cue.\nHowever, even with short, specific, and actionable cues, there is no guarantee the athlete\u2019s movement will improve\nThe trainer needs to use multiple cues until the fault is resolved. There are cases in which a cue that is effective for\none athlete is ineffective for another, and in other cases, even a good cue may result in poor movement. \u201cGet your"}

Nevertheless, some athletes interpret this cue to mean that the weight should be on their heels exclusively\nand they fall backwards or lose their balance. That does not mean the cue was bad or the trainer was wrong; it means\nthe trainer has to try an alternative cue.\nA trainer should not be limited to a certain set of cues for a specific fault, and he or she should continue to use differ-\nent cues until the movement improves. Over time, a trainer develops corrective strategies, building a bank of options\nfor every fault. These corrective strategies should include verbal (i.e., speaking), visual (i.e., showing), and tactile\n(i.e., touching) cues, all of which may be employed to fix the same fault but may be interpreted differently among\nathletes. Verbal cues tell the athlete a specific instruction, visual cues create contrasting images between current and\npreferred positioning, and tactile cues use physical targets to achieve proper mechanics. The greater the number of\nstrategies a trainer can employ for any fault, the more likely it is that he or she will be successful in correcting the fault\nTriaging faults\nDetermining which single fault to correct can be a challenge, as multiple faults often occur together. Ideally, every\nfault would be addressed simultaneously, but this is unrealistic in practice. The trainer is best served by triaging\nfaults. The term \u201ctriaging\u201d is most often used in medicine to assign urgency to those needing medical attention\nTriaging when coaching movement means assigning urgency to the multiple faults present in order of the most to\nleast important. Greater importance is assigned to faults that have the highest risk for injury (and, therefore, also the\ngreatest potential to limit performance). In a loaded environment, there are many cases in which the fault to address\nfirst would be loss of a neutral spine, usually in flexion. However, a flexed lumbar curve at depth in an air squat is less\nconcerning than that same position in a loaded back squat. This athlete needs to continue to air squat to full depth\nfighting for a neutral midline, all while maintaining the range of motion required by life. It is precisely the practice of\nthe movement, even with less-than-ideal mechanics, that will eventually allow him or her to reclaim positions that\ncan be loaded. In this example, completing the full range of motion was given more priority than midline stabilization\nThe ordering is based on the severity of the deviation from the ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task\nthere is no single ordering of faults that can be used across all athletes in all applications.\nWhichever fault the trainer decides to fix first should become the trainer\u2019s focus. He or she has to selectively ignore\nthe other faults present. Once that fault is fixed or mitigated at least to the degree that it is no longer the most import-\nant, the trainer can move on to the next issue.\nAfter choosing which fault to address, the trainer needs to know how the various faults are related. A trainer may\ncue a different body part than the one he or she is trying to fix due to the interrelatedness of movement mechanics\nSuppose an athlete performs an air squat with the following faults: weight shifting forward, knees collapsing, and\nback rounding. The trainer needs to consider: Are the caving knees causing the back to round? Is the rounded back\ncausing the weight to shift forward? Perhaps the trainer chooses to address the back position first but actually tells\nthe athlete, \u201cPush the knees out.\u201d There are cases in which allowing more room for the pelvis helps create a neutra\nspine position.\nAssess the cue\u2019s effectiveness and provide feedback\nAfter a trainer delivers a cue, he or she must stay with that athlete for at least another repetition to assess the result\nWhatever the athlete\u2019s response, the trainer needs to provide feedback. A trainer needs to let the athlete know if\nthe movement was the same, better, or worse. If the movement improves, a trainer needs to acknowledge that"}
{"266": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nperhaps with, \u201cThat\u2019s better\u201d or, \u201cGood correction.\u201d This helps the athlete develop kinesthetic awareness of proper\npositioning. In some cases, an athlete may improve movement but not to the desired degree. Encouraging these\nathletes simply to give more in that same direction is often a sound strategy (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s better, but even lower!\u201d). If\nthe movement has not changed, this could be addressed simply by saying, \u201cNot there yet\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019ll come back to you,\u201d\nfor example. An unsuccessful cue should not be repeated multiple times with a single athlete; instead, the trainer\nshould find a new cue. If the movement changes for the worse, the trainer also needs to immediately recognize this\nand stop or reverse it (e.g., \u201cOther way\u201d).\nNot staying to assess the effectiveness of a cue and provide the athlete with feedback is almost the same as not\ngiving a cue at all. If a trainer tells an athlete to do something and walks away before seeing the result, he or she may\nmiss it when a cue results in no change or even change for the worse. The athlete has no idea if his or her efforts\nhave resulted in improvement. All feedback, positive and negative, is tied to the athlete developing better kinesthetic\nawareness. Precision of word choice is critical. The use of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d needs to be reserved for actual sound or\nimproved mechanics and not used as a filler.\nThroughout the cueing process, a trainer must also be aware when praise for hard work (regardless of change) is\nnecessary. There are cases where no change or only a very slight change occurs in a session. Celebrating the effort\nacknowledges the hard work put forth that day and helps a client remain willing to continue to work hard. A trainer\njust needs to be clear when the praise is for the effort rather than a movement that still needs improvement.\ngrouP ManageMenT\nThe ability to organize and manage, both at a micro level (within each class) and at the macro level (the gym as a\nwhole). This includes managing time well; organizing the space, equipment, and participants for optimal flow and\nexperience; planning ahead; etc.\nGroup management is not just about organizing logistical considerations for a class so clients have enough space\ntime, and equipment to complete the workout. It is about optimally managing these variables to support the best\npossible instruction (see \u201cComponents of an Effective Class\u201d). Poor planning of any aspect of a class\u2014for example\nthe amount of time spent on certain parts, how the equipment is set up, and how much time is allotted to each par-\nticipant\u2014can detract from the quality of the experience.\nAdhere to the schedule\nAt its most basic level, effective group management means adhering to posted schedules. Clients plan their sched-\nules around these announced times, and it should not be assumed that they have more time or flexibility. Adhering\nto posted times means both starting and ending on time: Running over is as unacceptable as starting late. Ending\nlate usually occurs when a trainer does not plan ahead and think through the entire class schedule. Adhering to the\nschedule also includes the schedule within each class. Following a simple template (such as introduction, warm-up\nworkout, and post-workout) every class helps ensure necessary time is devoted to each piece (see \u201cComponents of\nan Effective Class\u201d). The trainer may also consider the experience level of the class to determine which pieces need\nmore time or less time during instruction.\nSpace and equipment layout\nGroup management also includes variables such as space layout and equipment availability. The layout needs to\naccount for buffer zones around any equipment in use and should also take into account when athletes have to move"}

Even in cases in which neither is limited, an effective trainer should have pre-determined alter-\nnatives for any class workout should a larger number of participants show up unexpectedly.\nGroup management speaks to the trainer\u2019s ability to reduce the logistical setup and preparation time during a class to\nmaximize the amount of teaching and movement time. This means the trainer plans ahead and perhaps prearranges\na complicated workout with multiple pieces of equipment and/or weights. Spending several or more minutes sorting\nequipment takes away from a trainer\u2019s time to instruct, improve, and refine movement.\nPlan how and what to teach\nTime spent on instruction can also reduce the client\u2019s practice time. A trainer needs to plan how and what to teach to\nmaximize the client\u2019s time moving. Allowing for enough practice time every class is necessary for both the trainer and\nclient. Less practice time gives the trainer less time to observe and cue movement mechanics, as well as less time for\na client to work on movement with improved form. Change in mechanics comes from continual cueing across many\nrepetitions.\nDuring every class, the trainer also needs to manage the attention given to each participant. Every student should\nfeel that he or she received enough attention. While some clients need more time than others, even good movers\nwith subtle inefficiencies need to be coached, pushed for higher speed and/or loads, or praised for sound perfor-\nmance. Attention still benefits them. To assist with each client getting enough individual attention, a helpful tool is\nto keep the group on the trainer\u2019s cadence for all repetitions during the warm-up or skill work. Controlling when the\ngroup moves ensures the same number of repetitions are completed by everyone. It also allows the trainer to sys-\ntematically and selectively observe individuals and specific aspects of their movement.\nThe size of the class affects how much time a trainer can spend with each person, but the class size should not be\nbeyond the trainer\u2019s capacity. The demands of large classes often turn trainers into crowd herders, timekeepers and\ncheerleaders who have little time to spend on cueing individual movement faults. Newer trainers (those with less\nthan two years of experience) can rarely find success when stepping into classes of 10-plus participants. In his article\n\u201cScaling Professional Training,\u201d CrossFit Founder Greg Glassman explained that after years of one-on-one persona\ntraining produced groups of two, eventually groups of three, and so on, his classes continued to grow until growth\nresulted in \u201cperceived reduction in attention\u201d to each paying member.\nRegardless of experience, trainers should make an honest assessment of the time and attention given to each client\nafter each training session. Did he or she make an assessment of each athlete\u2019s weaknesses? Did he or she make rea\nmovement change that session? If the answer to either question is no, the session was likely too large for the trainer\nThe goal is to maximize a trainer\u2019s effectiveness and reach.\nPresenCe and aTTiTude\nThe ability to create a positive and engaging learning environment, showing empathy for athletes and creating rapport\n\u201cPresence and attitude\u201d refers to the trainer\u2019s ability to create a positive atmosphere and develop a rapport with each\nclient.

The trainer recognizes that individuals respond\ndifferently to instruction and critique and makes it his or her responsibility to determine how best to relate to and\nmotivate each individual regardless of background and ability.\nA trainer must be aware of whether each client is interested in each class; a client\u2019s needs may change with the days\nand external life demands. The trainer should know what is happening with most of the group most of the time, and\nthis goes beyond movement mechanics. This includes issues such as who is struggling that day due to external pres-\nsures or stress, who has high energy, who is aloof or annoyed, who is new to the gym, etc. All these factors may affect\nthe degree to which the athletes can perform relative to their usual capacity. Effective trainers know these things\nbecause they routinely interact with their clients and are invested in their relationships with them.\nA common trait of trainers with a positive presence and attitude is that they genuinely care about their clients\u2019 success\nThis care means more to clients than the trainer\u2019s knowledge. Many clients have little interest in the technical aspects\nof training. Their interests often lie in unrelated professions and hobbies, and they are at the gym to improve the\nquality of their lives. The mechanisms of their success in the gym are much less important to them than the results\nand success itself. In addition to seeing results, clients know if they feel welcomed and cared for, respected, inspired\nand motivated. They can sense whether the trainer has their best interests at heart.\nBe authentic\nA positive presence and attitude cannot be faked; it comes from a sincere passion for service. It can take on many\nforms based on the trainer\u2019s personality and interpersonal skills. Trainers should not interpret this as being any single\ntrait, such as loud, funny, or bubbly. Trainers are encouraged to be authentic. There is room for any personality type\nto succeed if a trainer couples genuine caring with awareness of his or her limitations and recognizes the effect he\nor she may have on clients. This may motivate a trainer to become a better version of himself or herself. A trainer\nmay set personal goals to compensate for any perceived shortcomings. For example, a trainer who is perceived as\nreserved may make an effort to be at class early to welcome and greet each member.\nNewer trainers especially may be shy or nervous in front of a group, and this may blunt their presence and attitude\nSmall mechanical changes, such as eye contact, open body language, and smiling, can go a long way toward putting\nthe trainer\u2019s best foot forward.

Just like teaching, demonstration may have to be made more simple and obvious\nthan realistic and subtle to meet the needs of the trainees. In cases in which a trainer\u2019s mechanics are limited, using\nothers for demonstration is perfectly acceptable.

{"272": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nCOMMON MOVEMENT THEMES FOR FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS\ninTroduCTion\nThere are common movement themes displayed in all foundational movements, from the nine foundational move-\nments in the Level 1 Course to others such as the snatch, kipping pull-up, and handstand push-up. These movement\nthemes broadly categorize similar positions and movement patterns, whether the athlete is static (starting, receiving\nor finishing positions) or dynamic (moving between static positions).\nThese themes are:\n\u2022 midline stabilization,\n\u2022 core-to-extremity movement,\n\u2022 balance about the frontal plane,\n\u2022 posterior-chain engagement,\n\u2022 sound hip function,\n\u2022 active shoulders,\n\u2022 full range of motion about a joint, and\n\u2022 effective stance and/or grip.\nUnderstanding these themes and the contexts in which to apply them will give trainers the general principles for eval-\nuating movement. There are positions or movement patterns that do not fit neatly into these categories, as well as\nmovements that do not demonstrate all the themes. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. It is simply a classification\ntool that can be used to aid development of one\u2019s coaching skill set.\nThese themes are exemplified when an athlete performs a movement correctly (i.e., adhering to the points of per-\nformance). The movement themes increase the potential for improved performance and minimize the risk of injury\nSound mechanics aid performance and risk management by using positions with the best mechanical and muscular\nalignment, conferring safety, efficacy, and efficiency simultaneously.\nMidLine sTabiLiZaTion\nA \u201cmidline\u201d is a plane of bilateral symmetry, but it is used in CrossFit to specifically refer to the relationship of the\nspine (base of the head to the top of the hips) and pelvis during functional movement. The midline trisects the spine\nand bisects the pelvis when the two are in their neutral anatomical relationship. Stabilization means something has\nbeen made stable, or \u201cstatic.\u201d Midline stabilization refers to the athlete\u2019s capacity to prevent movement from this\nneutral spinal position and is synonymous with core strength. Midline stabilization determines whether the athlete\ncan maintain the natural S-curve of the spine to the pelvis when dynamic and/or loaded. Some lifting applications\nrely on a midline posture with some extension past neutral in both the lumbar and thoracic regions. Regardless, this\nposture is maintained throughout the movement.\nStabilization of the spine is largely accomplished by engaging the abdominals (\u201cabs\u201d), internal and external oblique\nmuscles (\u201cobliques\u201d), and erector spinae (\u201cspinal erectors\u201d or simply \u201cerectors\u201d). Engaging the abs helps engage the\nspinal erectors and obliques; together, they create a belt of musculature around the vertebrae."}
{"273": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nTorso as a rigid, integrated structure\nThis neutral, static position maximizes performance because moving the torso as one rigid, integrated structure\nenables the transmission of force between the appendages and the object being lifted. In a push jerk, for example\nthe legs and hips extend force upward into the weight through the torso. A soft midline does not allow for the optima\ntransfer of force to the bar.\nWhen maintaining a neutral spine, the orientation of the vertebrae results in favorable distribution of forces and\nreduces the risk for injury. Where possible, it is ideal to have the midline in a vertical orientation because of the optima\nmuscular and skeletal alignment for force distribution (e.g., in a squat). As the torso moves from a vertical orientation\nas in the deadlift, the demand on the musculature to maintain a neutral spine increases. Forward movement of the\ntorso, however, does not increase the risk of injury if midline stabilization is present. It is when midline stabilization\nis lost that the shear force experienced by the spine increases. The human spine is more susceptible to injury when\nexposed to shear (vs. compression) forces. The resulting shear force attempts to push one vertebra past another\nwhile muscles and ligaments resist this loss of positioning. If the muscles and ligaments are not strong enough, an\ninjury to the spine may occur.\nDeviations from neutral\nDeviations from neutral may occur in flexion (bending forward from neutral) or extension (bending backward from\nneutral). Recall that a natural function of the abdominals is to flex the spine, so spinal flexion by itself is not nec-\nessarily problematic (e.g., getting out of bed) and is potentially beneficial to reduce the lever arm (e.g., gymnastics\nholds). Similarly, the erectors extend the spine. Extending past neutral is not inherently dangerous but can become\nso depending on degree of deviation and the load on the body.\nThe following hierarchy of spinal positioning is listed in order of increasing risk for injury:\n\u2022 Safest: Midline stabilization in a neutral position.\n\u2022 More risky: A non-neutral spine in a static position. Although less ideal than midline stabilization in\na neutral position, static positions (flexed or extended) prevent movement of the individual spinal\nsegments. This means no individual vertebra bears the majority of the lifting force.\n\u2022 Most risky: Loss of a neutral spine during movement, specifically when starting from neutral and moving\nto significant spinal flexion. This is potentially the most injurious, as there is movement of the individual\nspinal segments and one or a few vertebra(e) bear the majority of the lifting force.\nThe most common injury from a loss of midline stabilization occurs when the lumbar spine (L1\u2013L5) flexes under\nload, changing the normal concave curvature of the lower back to convex. Typically, flexion of the spine is seen with\nincreased hip flexion or when the midline is resisting a load on the front side of the body, as in a deadlift.\nAthletes may also deviate from neutral by overextending or hyperextending the spine, which means significantly\nbending backward from neutral into an injurious range of motion. There is a difference between the natural S-curva-\nture of the spine and an exaggerated extension of the spine. Placing athletes in an overextended position does not\nincrease the benefits of a neutral spine and may place them at risk for injury.\nHyperextension can result in the same injuries as excessive flexion (i.e., disc herniation or damage to facet joints)\nHyperextension generally occurs with more flexible athletes or occasionally with more advanced athletes. Over-"}
{"274": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nextension or hyperextension often points to a lack of engagement of the abdominals and can generally be addressed\nby cueing an athlete to tighten the abs. It is most often seen when an athlete lifts overhead.\nCORE-TO-EXTREMITY MOVEMENT\nCore-to-extremity movements demonstrate a sequence of muscular contraction that begins with the large force-pro-\nducing, low-velocity muscles of the core (abdominals and spinal erectors) and hips, and ends with the small force-pro-\nducing, high-velocity muscles of the extremities (e.g., biceps, calves, wrist flexors). Core-to-extremity movement\nbegins with establishing midline stabilization for effective force transfer\u2014i.e., a base is created and force radiates\nfrom there. This muscular patterning teaches the athlete to fluidly transmit power from one area of the body to\nanother. Core-to-extremity movement maximizes performance because it tasks the largest musculature to generate\nforce first, allowing the greatest forces to develop. This sequence improves efficiency and allows the greatest amount\nof work to be accomplished.\nCore-to-extremity movements are less risky than movements that violate this pattern because the largest muscles\nare tasked with generating the most force. Smaller muscle groups and associated tendons and ligaments are more\nsusceptible to injury, such as tearing, when exposed to loading designed for larger movers.\nCore-to-extremity movements are found everywhere, not just with movements that involve the arms and legs, so\nfaults can show up everywhere. Even a shoulder press or a deadlift may not effectively demonstrate core-to-extrem-\nity movement absent a stable midline. For dynamic faults, core-to-extremity violations occur when there is incorrect\ntiming and the arms move before the hips and legs have extended (i.e., pulling or pushing early).\nBALANCE ABOUT THE FRONTAL PLANE\nThe frontal plane divides the athlete into anterior and posterior halves. It is the plane about which one is balanced\nand it bisects the athlete at mid-foot. Referencing the athlete\u2019s movement (i.e., his or her line of action) and the object\nhe or she is moving relative to the frontal plane can often determine the athlete\u2019s efficiency.\nSignificant deviations of the athlete and/or object forward of the frontal plane prevent successful task completion\nespecially as the loading increases. These deviations can also impair other points of performance (i.e., neutral spine\nweight on the heels). Generally, moving an object along straight lines (i.e., in the frontal plane) can increase perfor-\nmance by increasing efficiency as the object follows the shortest distance between two points. Note, however, the\nathlete\u2019s movement accommodates the object and may or may not be characterized by straight lines. For example\nin a movement such as the squat, an effective line of action is created when the hips sit back and down as the knees\nbend. In this manner, the athlete is best able to keep the weight on the heels, and when the squat is loaded, the bar\ntravels along the shortest line. This movement also can reduce excessive force at the patella, which may occur if the\nknees translate excessively forward (i.e., such that the heels come up).\nBalance about the frontal plane can also be referenced in a kipping pull-up, where the plane is formed along the\nline from the hands to the floor. The athlete is most efficient when the center of mass oscillates about this plane to\nmaintain the most efficient timing of the swing. In the kipping pull-up, when the center of mass deviates from the\nfrontal plane too much, the athlete loses timing and has to reset the swing.\nA lack of balance about the frontal plane may increase the risk for injury because of increased potential for other\nmovement errors. For example, if the chest drops in a front squat with the bar deviating forward of the fronta"}

However, a violation of balance about the frontal plane by itself is not\nterribly risky.\nPOSTERIOR-CHAIN ENGAGEMENT\nThe posterior chain includes the group of muscles, tendons, and ligaments on the posterior (back) of the body, which\ncontains the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), gluteal muscles (\u201cglutes\u201d), and spina\nerectors. \u201cEngagement\u201d means this musculature contributes to the movement. Posterior-chain engagement does not\nrefer to using the posterior chain in an attempt to exclude the anterior chain. Ideally, there is a balance of pressure\nbetween the balls of the feet and the heels, with the line of action at the frontal plane. Posterior-chain engagement\nalso enables the athlete to maintain optimal knee alignment with the foot.\nInclusion of this large set of musculature on the backside of the body maximizes performance because of the\nincreased power generation, thereby resulting in faster speed to completion or increased load lifted. Keeping the\nheels rooted brings the load closer to the frontal plane, which helps the athlete stay balanced and drive the load up\nnot forward. This increases efficiency. Engagement of the spinal erectors is also essential for maintaining midline\nstabilization and providing the strongest base to transmit forces.\nFinally, engagement of the posterior chain helps keep the knees in line with the toes, where there is the best mechan-\nical position of leverage between the upper and lower leg. With posterior-chain engagement, greater musculature is\nrecruited to move the load, and enough room is created for full range of motion in a squatting movement. When the\nknees collapse inward, the center of pressure shifts forward (given the angle at which the knees flex). This positioning\nis often a result of underdeveloped external rotators of the hip.\nPosterior-chain engagement contributes to safety because it promotes midline stabilization and balance about the\nfrontal plane. Also, keeping the knees in line with the toes reduces lateral and rotational forces at the knee joint\nThese forces are problematic for a hinge joint such as the knee, where associated tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and\nmenisci could be damaged when poor mechanics are allowed to go unchanged over long periods of time. It is less\nlikely that a single repetition causes significant damage to the joints, but thousands of repetitions performed over\ntime can wear on the knees\u2019 structural integrity.\nPressure in the feet\nA lack of posterior-chain engagement results in the athlete (and/or object) shifting excessively forward of the fronta\nplane. A trainer can see this by observing the center of pressure in the feet in all movements, especially with any knee\nor hip flexion. This may or may not occur in conjunction with the heel coming off the floor. The heel can remain on the\nground while the center of pressure shifts forward.\nThis may also indicate premature shifting of weight to the toes, especially during an explosive hip extension, which\nresults in the hip extending forward rather than upward. If an athlete jumps forward during a lift, it may be an indica-\ntion of a premature shift of weight to the toes. \u201cTriple extension\u201d is not a forced calf raise in conjunction with exten-\nsion of the knees and hips; it is achieved when the heels leave the ground because of, and after, a violent extension\nthereby creating extension of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Analysis of elite lifters shows that the longer a lifter\nremains in contact with the ground during the second pull, the greater the acceleration on the bar. Greater surface\narea in contact with the ground enables a greater force to be transferred."}
{"276": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nKnee position\nWith regard to knee position, although there are two directions the knees can travel to come out of alignment with\nthe feet (laterally or medially), the fault is usually seen when the knees collapse inward (medially). The degree of devi-\nation in knee alignment generally increases with increased hip and knee flexion in a movement and/or wider stances\nAn athlete with a poor knee position in any movement often produces the error to some degree any time the knee\nflexes. For example, an athlete whose knees collapse in a squat is likely to have the knees collapse to a less obvious\ndegree in running, box jumps, push presses, etc.\nSOUND HIP FUNCTION\nSound hip function refers to the athlete\u2019s ability to flex and extend the hip to maximize its contribution to a move-\nment. The hamstrings and glutes are powerful hip extensors. Powerful and complete hip extension is necessary for\nelite athletic capacity because:\n1. it applies the most force on the object, and\n2. it creates the most elevation on the object, giving the athlete the most time to accommodate or receive it.\nThere are no major safety issues with slow or incomplete hip extension.\nPoor hip function is usually expressed in one of three ways:\n1. muted hip,\n2. lack of hip extension, and/or\n3. slow hip extension.\nA muted hip never closes/flexes (and therefore is a \u201cpermanently\u201d open hip). If the hip never closes, the movement is\npredominantly driven by the quadriceps. The quadriceps extend the knee without contribution from the hamstrings\nand glutes. Lack of hip extension does not allow the power of the hamstrings and glutes to be fully expressed. This\ndoes not effectively put acceleration on the bar or object and therefore does not elevate it to any significant degree\nEven small deviations from full hip extension result in reduced power transmission. The speed of hip extension\nplays a critical role in accelerating the object being lifted, particularly when the object must be elevated far beyond\nits starting point (e.g., from rack to overhead). In all cases, the power of the musculature of the hips is not opti-\nmally expressed.\nACTIVE SHOULDERS\nAn active shoulder provides the most stable position for the shoulder when working against a load. This means an\nactive shoulder is present in the overhead lifts as well as the deadlift series, including the deadlift, sumo deadlift high\npull, and medicine-ball clean. Outside the nine foundational movements, active shoulders are found in the kipping\npull-up, ring dip, handstand push-up, row, and snatch, among other movements.\nActive shoulders are about scapular position and stabilization and require different actions by the athlete, depend-\ning on the movement. In each movement, the athlete attempts to keep the shoulder in a relatively neutral, natura\nposition, without yielding to a load. At the same time, he or she will create enough space between the anatomica\nstructures of the shoulder so they may pass freely without impingement. Typically, this means an athlete demon-\nstrates an active shoulder by applying force in the direction opposite the load. For example, in an overhead squat, the\nathlete pushes up on the barbell. In a push-up, the athlete pushes down into the ground. In a row, the athlete pulls"}
{"277": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nback to prevent the rounding of the shoulders. There are also cases in which an active shoulder is not achieved by\npushing into the load (e.g., bench press). In all cases, the retraction, elevation, etc. is not taken to the end range that\nresults in a contrived position. For example, retraction in a deadlift is not full retraction that may result in a loss of\nmidline stabilization or a position that would not be possible under any real load.\nAn active shoulder creates optimal skeletal alignment, which enables the most musculature of the torso (e.g., tra-\npezius) to aid in the stability of the shoulder and potentiate the greatest force. An active shoulder also moves the\nacromion process out of the way of the humerus, reducing the chance for impingement of the biceps tendons and\nrotator-cuff muscles. The chances for impingement increase as the grip narrows. In an overhead squat, for example\na wider grip requires less elevation to create clearance space.\nWhen an athlete loses an active shoulder, the direction the shoulders move (e.g., forward, down) depends on the\nmovement. The coach needs to observe from where the force is being applied and determine if the shoulders are\nmoving in that same direction (e.g., yielding).\nfuLL range of MoTion abouT a JoinT\nFull range of motion about a joint describes the natural anatomical beginning and end positions of a movement. Ful\nrange of motion allows a greater complement of musculature to be used (e.g., reaching full depth in a squat, using\nactive shoulders) and in some cases better mechanical advantage (e.g., bar resting on the body in the front rack)\nJoint safety is maximized by preserving the range of motion required by life while best distributing forces at any one\njoint or throughout a series of joints. Additionally, increasing the musculature and joints involved allows the athlete\nto develop the neuromuscular coordination that is universally found in compound movements and sport.\nToward the other extreme, hyperextension or artificially trying to create more range of motion past a joint\u2019s natura\nanatomical function can be detrimental to joint health; more is not always better.\nTraining to the full range of motion in functional movements best prepares an individual for any conceivable task\nWhile life\u2019s tasks may not always require full range of motion, training to the limits of one\u2019s natural end range prevents\ndeficiencies if and when the joints need to move the full range. Using full range of motion preserves joint health, flex-\nibility, and strength, reducing the chance of injury and decrepitude later in life. If there is not a more pressing safety\nissue that needs to be fixed first, a trainer needs to preserve full range of motion above much else (e.g., adding load\nincreasing speed).\neffeCTive sTanCe and/or griP\nThis refers to the foot and hand positions adopted during a movement, where the optimal stance and grip promote\ntask accomplishment and the ability to display all the movement\u2019s points of performance.\nThere are two common stances in CrossFit. A narrower stance (hip width) is used in the deadlifts, presses, and the\nOlympic lifts. The hip-width stance promotes a more direct transfer of force through the heels/floor and into the\nobject being moved. A wider stance (shoulder width) is used in squatting movements, allowing for greater depth\nand contribution of the posterior chain. Some force-transfer efficiency may be lost with the wider stance (relative to\nhip width), but function and range of motion are gained. It is possible to take a different stance to allow for different\nloading mechanics. For example, a wider stance is adopted in the sumo deadlift. This allows the torso to remain more\nupright, allowing the legs and hips to more readily assist the back during the lift."}
{"278": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nThe grip is usually outside the shoulders or hips so as not to interfere with the object or other points of performance\nbut it may also be wider if the demands of the movement require it. For example, the grip in the deadlift should\nbe wide enough so as not to interfere with the legs, but it is significantly wider in the snatch to reduce the overal\ndistance the bar must travel.\nIn many real-life applications with odd objects, a wider stance or narrower grip may be used. It is critical for athletes\nto learn how to apply the other points of performance, regardless of the stance and grip used to accommodate an\nobject. This is especially true of preparing an athlete for situations outside the gym, when a more convenient stance\nand grip are not always possible.\nThere are no major safety concerns from a lack of effective stance or grip except when other points of performance\nare adversely affected. The value of any stance and grip adjustment should be assessed based upon its effect on al\nthe other points of performance in the movement.\nASSESSING SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE\nSimply observing an athlete\u2019s position in a movement does not provide enough of a context to assess safety risk and\nperformance benefit. Both are assessed in light of the individual\u2019s:\n1. athletic capacity,\n2. loading,\n3. positioning, and\n4. speed of execution.\nA trainer cannot identify bad positions without this greater context. Decreased performance and increased injury are\nmore likely as the athlete moves further from a sound position or as loads increase relative to the athlete\u2019s maximum\nFor example, picking up a grocery bag with a rounded back is a common occurrence and contains little safety risk\nfor many CrossFit athletes. Nevertheless, this same positioning could be more problematic for a beginner deadlifting\n135 lb. or an advanced competitive athlete deadlifting 500 lb.\nIn daily training, athletes are encouraged to exercise using the correct positions to develop strength and awareness\nUsing sound mechanics promotes greater potential for power development and decreases injury risk in the long\nterm. Training in the best positions, regardless of the load present, develops a sound default motor pattern that\nbetter prepares athletes for loaded and high-intensity scenarios.\nBecause of the benefits to safety, efficacy, and efficiency, proper mechanics are a daily focus of CrossFit trainers\nWorking toward better movement is not only for beginners and is arguably more important as the athlete advances\nThe margin for error decreases as load and speed increase. Top competitors rely on efficiencies that can create\nseconds of gain. A trainer cannot settle for anything less than excellent mechanics. For example, an immature squat\nmay be a safe position, but if the athlete can learn to lift the chest, every degree of elevation can increase the loads\nthat can be lifted in a clean or snatch, for example. A trainer must challenge himself or herself to develop better\nathletes beyond their current capacity."}
{"279": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nConCLusion\nThese themes provide a template from which a trainer can evaluate all movement in order to maximize both safety\nand performance for his or her athletes. The ability to recognize and correct violations is essential for a trainer\nregardless of whether the athlete\u2019s violation is major or minor.\nUnderstanding these themes provides a template for evaluating other approaches to coaching a movement. These\nthemes also can help a coach think critically about any methods before including them in instruction: If there is not\na clearly demonstrable mechanism that creates a safer or more effective movement, it is usually an unnecessary\ndistraction.\nFor example, suppose a coach considers a new starting posture for the snatch or clean. He or she wants to use a\ndynamic start such that the athlete moves through the setup without a pause before the first pull. If the athlete\nis able to achieve the common themes (e.g., midline stabilization, posterior-chain engagement, balance about the\nfrontal plane) in a static start and there is no clear performance gain from a dynamic start (i.e., increased loads lifted)\nit becomes an unnecessary layer of complexity to add to the mechanics of the lift.

{"282": "Heavy Days, continued\nHEAVY DAYS\nThere is the tendency for new CrossFit athletes and trainers to avoid heavy days entirely or execute them incorrectly.\nHowever, CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program. While people sometimes characterize CrossFit by its pro-\ngramming of mixed-modal workouts for time (\u201cmet-cons\u201d), this is a limited view. Days devoted to strength training\nare essential to CrossFit and are integral to CrossFit\u2019s prescription of constantly varied workouts.\nHeavy days are necessary to build top-end strength and power. Power output decreases with time, meaning that an\nathlete\u2019s work capacity in very short time domains sets the theoretical limit for his or her entire curve (Figure 1). It is\npossible to have high levels of short-duration power and little power elsewhere (e.g., a powerlifter), but it is impossi-\nble to have low levels of short-duration power and higher levels of longer-duration power. Therefore, heavy days are\nessential to a general physical preparedness program and should be used at least once a week or once every two\ncycles (where a cycle is three on, one off).\nfigure 1. Generalized work-capacity curve.\nHeavy days are not the only time athletes drive strength adaptations. Even within a metabolic-conditioning workout,\ndepending on the task and the capacity of the athlete, any number of exercises may build strength. Push-ups for\nnovices build pressing strength similar to a bench press, and attempting a 95-lb. thruster for a new CrossFit athlete\nbuilds squatting strength. As an athlete\u2019s strength increases, push-ups and 95-lb. thrusters tend to favor other adap-\ntations such as stamina, and greater loads are necessary to further increase top-end power.\nHeavy days can be completed with most any weightlifting or gymnastics movement, such as weighted dips and\npull-ups and lifting odd objects (e.g., sandbags, axles). More often than not, however, a barbell is best because it is\nimpossible to match the barbell\u2019s ease and range of loading with other equipment. Heavy days may also include all\nvariations of standard barbell movements (e.g., hang, power, from a deficit, pulling from pins/bumpers)."}
{"283": "Heavy Days, continued\nRepetition schemes\nThe heavy-day workout consists of small sets, most often in the range of 1 to 5 repetitions, where the total volume of\nworking repetitions is approximately 7 to 25. Repetitions significantly outside this range do not produce the desired\nresponse. If there are too few repetitions (e.g., one repetition of a near-maximum load), the athlete does not produce\nenough stress on the taxed muscles to drive a new adaptation. Conversely, too many repetitions (e.g., 30 or more\nrepetitions of near-maximum load) produces too much stress for the athlete to recover from in a reasonable time\nperiod. The working sets generally occur at or above 80\u201385 percent of a 1-repetition-maximum load, and warm-up\nsets used to get to this loading do not count toward the total working repetitions. This is not an exact percentage\nbut a working set should be heavy enough to require concentrated effort. The working sets also do not produce a\nsignificant cardiorespiratory response.\nRepetition schemes may vary. As a general guideline, the higher the repetitions in a set or across the entire session\nthe lower the loading. This tends to better develop muscular stamina and/or technique. The lower the repetitions\nthe higher the loading. This tends to better develop top-end strength. Both approaches should be used. Repetition\npatterns include standard schemes such as 7 x 1, 5 x 3, 5 x 5 (sets x reps); pyramid-like patterns of 1-2-3-2-1 (reps\nper set); descending/ascending schemes such as 5-4-3-2-1 (reps per set); no set specificity (e.g., work up to a max\npush press); and on-the-minute training (1, 2, or 3 repetitions on the minute, every minute for 10 minutes), among\nothers. Failed attempts count toward working sets. However, the goal of a session should be to complete the majority\nof the lifts.\nHeavy days are for everyone: the young, old, fit, and unfit. Using the concept of relative intensity, a trainer has each\nathlete lift a load that is relatively heavy for him or her. Even beginners should participate, although a trainer should\nbe more cautious progressing a new athlete in load. Trainers can potentially give beginners more repetitions (either\nwithin each set or by increasing the total number of sets) to very gradually progress to a reasonably challenging\nworking weight while instilling appropriate mechanics. Relatively new athletes often set a personal record every time\nthey lift heavy. As the lifter becomes more experienced, sessions without a new personal record may occur. Setting\na personal record is not necessary to reap the benefits of lifting heavy.\nMinimizing risk\nAs risk increases with load, the trainer has several safety concerns to manage when leading a strength session. A\nheavy-day class best begins with a thorough warm-up to prepare the athletes for maximal loading (e.g., increase\ncore temperature and improve range of motion). It also provides the trainer with an opportunity to correct and\nrefine mechanics across warm-up sets of the movement to minimize risk. Finding the best way to complete warm-up\nsets usually becomes an intuitive process as athletes become more experienced with lifting heavy. However, most\nathletes in their first few years still need direction through this section. Common practice for warm-up sets is at\nleast 3 to 5 warm-up sets, where the sets start with a lighter weight/higher repetition count and progress to heavier\nweight/lower repetition count. The rest periods in the warm-up sets do not need to be as long as during the working\nsets. Whatever the warm-up is, trainers cannot fatigue the athlete for the work sets. Instead, warm-up sets gradually\nprime the body for heavier loading while refining the mechanics of the lift.\nThe trainer must also teach each athlete how to bail and/or spot as necessary before any significant weight is\nattempted. It is easiest to have participants practice this with a PVC or dowel. A trainer cannot assume athletes\nwill perform bailing or spotting techniques correctly without specific instructions. The gym floor also needs to be"}

Trainers may choose to have participants share racks, in part to reduce equipment and space needs. Sharing\nracks also allows athletes to help one another with loading, unloading, and spotting. It also allows for adequate\nrest time between sets so athletes fully recover. When using racks, additional instructions are needed to ensure\nthat athletes keep enough distance between themselves and the racks when lifting. The trainer needs to clearly\ndescribe how the working sets should be approached to avoid confusion. For example, the workout may be 5 x 5\nfront squats. Does the trainer want the athletes to try to increase the load with every set? Does the trainer want the\nathletes to hold a certain percentage across all sets? Or does the trainer perhaps want the athletes to find a new\n5-repetition maximum, meaning the exact number of working sets is less important (maybe it takes 4 sets, maybe\n5 sets)? All these approaches have validity and potential benefits, but the trainer needs to indicate what the intent is\non a particular day.\nDuring the working sets, the trainer must appropriately apply the principles of threshold training just as he or she\nwould in any other workout. Once an athlete\u2019s mechanics significantly deviate from the points of performance, the\nload needs to be reduced. This is especially true when multiple verbal and visual cues do not result in any improve-\nment in mechanics. It is possible that the trainer can fix the mechanics at lighter loads and then allow the athlete to\nagain increase the load gradually. Deviations from points of performance may also require the trainer to change the\nmovement for a few repetitions before using the entire movement (e.g., using snatch pulls to correct an athlete who\nis pulling early in the full snatch). Once the workout is complete, the trainer should include equipment clean-up and\nworkout logging as part of the cool-down period.\nCueing during a heavy lifting session needs to be very direct. The athlete\u2019s attention will be almost solely focused\non the effort required to complete the lift. The trainer will have little time or opportunity to impact the quality of the\nmovement during the set. Therefore, cues need to be short, easy to implement, and delivered with an intensity that\nmatches the effort of the lift. If more technical consideration is needed, the time between sets can be a great oppor-\ntunity to elaborate. However, upon returning to the next set, the athlete should have a very clear picture of what he or\nshe needs to focus on. Giving your athlete more than one or two things to think about often results in no change at all\nConCLusion\nTrainers need to regularly program strength days with their clients and ensure all participants achieve the desired\nstimulus during the training session. These sessions provide coaches and athletes with opportunities to improve\nmechanics, acquire new skills, and see progress in a modality that is vital to developing the fitness CrossFit seeks."}

During the Level 1\nnutrition lecture, participants were walked through the importance of eating quality foods, and there was discussion\nof a few common ways to quantify food intake. Eating meats, vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and\nno sugar in combination with weighing and measuring macronutrient quantities can have a profound effect on one\u2019s\nhealth and performance outcomes.\nA tsunami of chronic disease has been sweeping across the world, and CrossFit affiliates are the lifeboats. Each gym\nhas within its walls the necessary ingredients to make profound changes to one\u2019s health.\nAs a coach, knowing what to eat, how to eat, and why it is important is only half the battle. The real struggle is in\nimplementing dietary changes and trying to create a high level of compliance.\nPerhaps one of the most important aspects of behavior change is one\u2019s belief that he or she is capable of making a\nspecific change. This is considered one\u2019s self-efficacy.\nIt is very important for coaches to know they have everything they need in the gym to increase an athlete\u2019s self-effi-\ncacy. Coaches should feel equipped to set up the perfect intervention to get athletes eating better for long periods\nof time, if not indefinitely.\nIt is up to the coach to help increase athletes\u2019 self-efficacy and encourage them to believe that changes are possible.\nIncreases in self-efficacy are a result of:\n\u2022 Mastery experiences: These are small achievable steps throughout the process. Success in these steps will\nincrease self-belief (i.e., adding vegetables to each meal).\n\u2022 A coach\u2019s ability to adjust to different emotional and physiological states: A coach must adjust to how others\nperceive change and deal with stress (i.e., be sensitive to the fact that Rebecca has always eaten this way,\nand she has three young children to consider).\n\u2022 Vicarious experiences: Coaches should use the successes of others to convince athletes that they, too, can\nbe successful (i.e., Joe started by cutting out low-quality food for a month. Then he would quantify only his\nbreakfast. Eventually, he measured his lunch, and six months later, he has lost 40 lb.).\n\u2022 Verbal/social persuasion: Athletes should receive verbal support from others, including from role models\n(the trainer) and/or in small groups (i.e., create an accountability buddy, send reminders, videos, articles\ncontaining any material that motivates the individual to stay the course).\nThese are four factors that affect self-efficacy (Bandura). These factors should be sought in combination with each\nother for best results.\nWhen thinking about behavior change within the context of a gym environment, we can understand the stages of\nchange as contemplation, action, and maintenance. These three stages apply most accurately to the gym environ-\nment and the relationship between coach and athlete."}
{"291": "Nutrition, continued\nContemplation: The athlete has a desire to make a change and recognizes that his or her behavior may be problematic\nAction: The behavior change has been initiated and healthier behaviors are being acquired.\nMaintenance: There is sustained healthy behavior and the athlete has developed the skills to deal with relapse.\nA key component to successfully changing behavior and progressing through each stage is self-efficacy. Does the\nathlete believe in his or her ability to change eating habits and to eat the optimal ratios and amounts?\nConTeMPLaTion\nA coach must first educate. Teaching the art of nutrition is no different than teaching functional movements. It stil\nrequires an in-depth knowledge of the material:\n\u2022 What are quality foods? What are unhealthy foods? How do you replace the unhealthy foods with healthier\nchoices?\n\u2022 How do you quantify macronutrients, and what tools are needed to weigh and measure?\n\u2022 Why is changing your diet important, and what are the expected outcomes?\n\u2022 What skills do you need to make this change and maintain it?\nCoaches then need to find the best way to communicate this information to their athletes. The explanation must be\nsimple, actionable, and realistic. This starts the process of building the skill set and producing the incentives required\nto make meaningful changes to diet.\nSuccessful gyms have accomplished this in a number of ways.\n\u2022 Small Nutrition Talks\n{ These talks are often provided during introductory sessions.\n{ Each small talk builds on the one prior. Athletes continue to develop knowledge and enhance skills\nin small steps (mastery experiences).\n{ Typically, food logs are used to determine necessary changes. This food log can easily be used in the\nlatter stages of change.\n\u0083 Any errors in the food log should be identified, and there should be positive and actionable\nsteps to fix them.\n{ Athletes are provided with everything, from shopping lists to recipes.\n\u0083 This level of information is necessary to actually perform the new behavior. The assumption\nthat building a shopping list is easy is one of the reasons many do not succeed. The coach\nmust guide this process.\n\u2022 Large Nutrition Lectures\n{ Typically, these are lectures that cover everything from eating quality foods to using different ways\nto weigh and measure food.\n{ The information is provided all at once to a large group of athletes, typically with a question and\nanswer session at the end.\n{ These tend to be used as an introduction to nutrition challenges.\n\u0083 The main points might be covered again in a small group format during the challenge.\nIt is important to understand that how someone perceives the journey will also have a profound impact on the results\nPerception is reality. This is where the trainer must adjust to the emotional and physiological state of the athlete."}
{"292": "Nutrition, continued\n\u2022 If an athlete is depressed, anxious, or scared about the behavior change, there will likely be a negative\nimpact on the outcome. The barriers to undertaking the behavior change might seem more severe than\nthey actually are.\n\u2022 Obviously, not everyone reacts this way to negative stress. Some are very confident in their abilities.\nMaybe they have some past experience with being a high-level athlete, or they are very successful in other\nareas of their life. These experiences can be used as a way to sustain efforts necessary for optimal results.\n\u2022 That being said, the majority of the people who are trying to progress from sickness to wellness will have\nsome level of self-doubt, fear, or anxiety.\nA good coach is sensitive to the state of the athlete and finds ways to relieve stress and make the experience positive\nThis becomes very important in group nutrition challenges. Remember, half the battle is instilling belief in the athletes\nthat they can do it. Consider the following:\n\u2022 Being part of a group can be extremely intimidating, especially if you are the least fit.\n\u2022 Successful coaches key into this right away and find a mentor to work closely with this type of athlete.\nMentors should be positive, relatable, and reliable.\n\u2022 Sometimes, the coach becomes the mentor and makes himself or herself available for extra guidance and\nmotivation.\naCTion\nOnce the athlete is ready to start, the coach needs to find ways to initiate change and keep it going. It is easy to\ncomplete a nutrition challenge and then fall back into old habits, eating the same way as before.\nVicarious experiences\nOne way a trainer can keep this behavior going is to provide vicarious experiences.\n\u2022 Find members that have had long-term success and use their stories. These people are now role models\nand their journeys are powerful!\n\u2022 If you don\u2019t have these people within your own gym, look for them in the community. There are countless\nexamples of people who have found significant results with changes to diet and consistent CrossFit training.\n\u2022 It is important that you use a variety of real-life success stories, and the closer to home, the better.

At the same time, they will have developed the confidence and strength they need to continue to\nexperience the benefits of this lifestyle change.\nSuccess stories need to be shared regularly by any means possible. This could be on the website, social media plat-\nforms, or within and on the walls of the gym itself. The more exposure and opportunity to highlight the success of\nothers, the better.\n\u2022 Try to provide as much detail as you can.\n{ What was the person\u2019s starting point?\n{ Where did he or she struggle?\n{ How did the person get through the tough times?\n{ What is he or she doing to stay on target?"}

If an athlete is overwhelmed by the idea of completely changing his or her\nfood quality, weighing and measuring food, and starting a CrossFit program, it might make sense to walk the athlete\nthrough this transition one step at a time.\n\u2022 Mastery experiences can come in the form of incremental changes to the diet and celebrations of small\nvictories.\n\u2022 The coach needs to provide actionable steps for the athlete to achieve his or her goals, and athletes need\nto believe that these steps are achievable.\n\u2022 Providing achievable small steps can come in the form of simply helping an athlete create one healthy\nmeal at a time. Satisfying this challenge will boost an athlete\u2019s confidence in his or her abilities and help in\nthe pursuit of the next step.\n\u2022 After athletes have shown they can successfully and consistently create a healthy meal, the coach should\nchallenge them to create two. This is the journey.\nThere are successful gyms that start challenges with step-by-step elimination.

{"297": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nPROGRAM DESIGN AND SCALING\nCrossFit is defined as \u201cconstantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity,\u201d with the goal to develop\nfitness that prepares one optimally for any task imaginable. The programming material of the Level 1 Course outlines\nworkout variables and basic considerations for structuring workouts. The programming material at this course builds\non that foundation by focusing on long-term program design for individuals and groups.\nAmong the myriad variables to control when programming workouts, a trainer cannot lose sight of the small influ-\nence programming has among a host of other factors that determine a client\u2019s success. Programming, whether\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d is secondary to effective coaching, appropriate scaling, using sound mechanics, and developing a\ngroup dynamic conducive to pushing oneself (i.e., highest intensity brought to the work). Even with less-than-optimal\nprogramming, a trainer who has a good eye for movement mechanics and develops a good rapport with his or her\nclients will help people improve their fitness for years. Functional movements performed at high intensity, regard-\nless of how well they are combined and varied, are powerful enough to elicit dramatic changes in one\u2019s health and\nperformance, particularly for the unaccustomed. Therefore, trainers can spend more time focusing on their skill set\nand member rapport rather than striving beyond reason to create the \u201cperfect\u201d template and programming cycles.\nANALYZING PROGRAMMING FOR EFFECTIVENESS\nEffective or \u201cgood\u201d programming produces results, and the relative degree to which programming is effective is the\ndegree to which it optimizes fitness. The standard by which to evaluate any programming is measurable improve-\nment in performance markers. For a CrossFit athlete, results would include increased loads on heavy days, decreased\ntimes on task-priority workouts, and increased repetitions or rounds on time-priority workouts. An optimal program\nwould see the maximum possible increases in any test of fitness.\nOther measurable markers include health markers. Faster Fran times, more rounds of Cindy, and heavier 1-repe-\ntition-maximum clean and jerks are correlated with decreases in blood pressure, triglycerides, and resting heart\nrate. Additional results may be reported by clients, such as improved quality of life, improved confidence, increased\nenergy, and mood alteration. Anecdotal improvements in quality of life are side benefits of CrossFit. While not mea-\nsurable, they are valued by many clients over the metrics of improved workout statistics and health markers.\nIneffective programming does not produce results, or at least not to the same degree possible with effective pro-\ngramming. These suboptimal results could include decreased performance on benchmark workouts, merely modest\nimprovements in performance markers, or even a higher rate of injury, which could be easily avoided by following\nother programming.\nThe key is that program effectiveness is based on results: real changes in measurable, observable, repeatable\nmarkers. Clients need to get results for the programming to be deemed effective.\nTrainers programming for a group or an entire affiliate can simply use the same measurement applied across the\nentire gym population. A trainer can look for long-term trends and patterns in the group by assessing performance\non select benchmarks. For example, a trainer may select specific benchmarks to follow: He or she may track clients\n1-repetition-maximum snatch, 1-repetition-maximum back squat, Grace, Fran, Tabata squats, 1-mile run, JT, Fight\nGone Bad, 5-km row, and Cindy as his or her fitness tests. An evaluation does not have to include these exact"}

As long as\nthe majority of members are improving their scores on these days, the programming is effective. A trainer must\nremember that this is a long-term view, and he or she cannot expect everyone to set a personal record (PR) with every\nbenchmark test due to variables beyond his or her control, such as mood, sleep, stress, the physiology of the athlete\nand even the athlete\u2019s commitment to the program. Intermediate to advanced athletes, for example, cannot expect\nto set personal records every time they repeat a workout due to the decreased magnitude of adaptations that result\nfrom increased proficiency (i.e., the learning curve).\nvarianCe in CrossfiT PrograMMing\n\u201cVariance\u201d refers to the intended variation of functional movements, loads, repetition schemes, and time durations\nwithin a single workout and across a series of workouts in order to best maximize one\u2019s fitness. Other factors (e.g.\nenvironment, gear) can be varied but are not the primary variables to consider. The variation of workout variables\nacross months and years determines how well one is prepared for any conceivable test of fitness. A program with\na narrow focus may show great results in one area but have little impact on another. For example, a powerlifting\nprogram may see increases in strength and power for certain lifts, but it might produce worse performance in lon-\nger-duration, higher-repetition scenarios or even decreased strength and power in certain other lifts, like the snatch\nIn the name of variance, there are few absolutes for formulating the infinite combinations of workout variables. An\nerror in programming variance is only problematic when the error becomes routine. Today\u2019s workout does not have a\ndramatic impact on one\u2019s fitness; it is the series of workouts that result in long-term change. Programming too many\nheavy days in a row, for example, develops a narrow capacity. Conversely, programming a few heavy days back-to-\nback on occasion may be an entirely appropriate or beneficial stimulus.\nLong-term planning and routine assessment\nEffectively combining workout variables over the long term requires intentional and careful planning. The program-\nmer must be well versed in CrossFit methodology to understand similar and disparate stimuli, as well as which\nstimuli are the most potent. Programming requires reviewing what has been completed recently in an attempt to\nprovide new variance. It must also allow for routine assessment to ensure progress is occurring.\nTo a lesser degree, the programmer must understand each athlete\u2019s current capacity and weaknesses. For any\nlevel of athlete, a well-varied program should cover many different aspects of fitness. As an athlete becomes more\nadvanced (e.g., a CrossFit Games competitor), additional time may be needed to improve weaknesses in addition to\nregular CrossFit programming. Regardless, effective programming cannot be random. Although CrossFit program-\nming appears random to some due to its non-linear and non-formulaic pattern, its variety is a result of a planned\nattempt to address all fitness tests. This does not happen by the luck of the draw.\nCrossFit.com programming\nCrossFit.com provides a great expression of variance for general physical preparedness. An athlete who can perform\nall main-site workouts as prescribed (Rx\u2019d) has a robust fitness capacity. Across all the workouts on CrossFit.com\nsome very broad trends suggest some combinations are more useful than others to develop this level of fitness\nCrossFit more frequently programs whole-body, natural, high-power movements in short, intense workouts because\nof their far-reaching effects on one\u2019s overall fitness. These principles are generally expressed in task-priority couplets\nand triplets of 15 minutes or less, which include full-body, high-power movements utilizing complementary functions\n(e.g., pulling vs. pressing). This simple, but highly effective\u2014i.e., elegant\u2014programming drives CrossFit\u2019s potency. A"}
{"299": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nprogrammer cannot be fooled into believing the simplicity of the movements and combinations equates to \u201csimple\u201d\nresults. Complexity does not inherently produce greater efficiency or efficacy, and arguably it detracts from both.\nClassic CrossFit benchmark workouts such as Fran, Helen, Diane, Elizabeth, and Fight Gone Bad are all excellent\nexamples of these basic principles. Fran (21-15-9 repetitions of thrusters and pull-ups) is an elegant combination\ntwo full-body movements, complementary in function (lower-body push and upper-body pull) to allow intensity to\nremain high while simultaneously expressing functions necessitated by life (squatting, putting an object overhead\npulling the body up).\nCrossFit programming is best summarized in World-Class Fitness in 100 Words, by CrossFit Founder Coach Greg\nGlassman: \u201cPractice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C & J (clean and jerk), and snatch. Similarly\nmaster the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips\nsplits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc., hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many\ncombinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly\nlearn and play new sports.\u201d\nAlthough many CrossFit workouts follow these trends, not all should. Less frequently, athletes need to be exposed to\nworkouts that are more unorthodox. For example, there are times when workout variables that result in decreased\npower output are entirely beneficial for an individual. A load that may be too heavy for an athlete to move con-\ntinuously in a workout is also a stimulus for greater strength. A high-repetition scheme that causes the athlete to\nstop multiple times in a single set is a stimulus for greater stamina. Even using lower-powered movements such\nas a Turkish get-up in a workout are useful occasionally for developing greater coordination, balance, and shoulder\nstrength under cardiorespiratory stress. The bulk of workouts, however, should strive for simple, bold pairings.\noPTiMiZing CrossfiT PrograMMing\nMost every client can improve his or her fitness without individualized programming. Small adjustments in the\ncontext of regular CrossFit programming, such as weakness work and scaling workouts appropriately, can accelerate\na client\u2019s results within general group programming.\nWorking weaknesses\nA weakness is a certain skill that is lacking relative to an athlete\u2019s proficiency in other areas. By improving one\u2019s\ncapacity in these weak areas, the athlete\u2019s overall fitness increases. Effective CrossFit programming by itself is aimed\ntoward improving weaknesses. With well-varied, unbiased combinations of loads, time durations, movements\netc., clients inevitably see improvements in their fitness for years. Over the months and years, just performing the\nelements one struggles with will improve one\u2019s proficiency in these movements.\nAn athlete may choose to do additional weakness work to accelerate progress and will likely find this also improves\nstrengths. Working on weaknesses is also important for clients who have reached a plateau. Coach Glassman has\nasserted the following: \u201cThere is more traction, more advantage, more opportunity in pursuing that one thing that\nyou don\u2019t want to see come out (of the hopper) headlong than to put more time into that thing you\u2019re already good\nat. That thing that you don\u2019t want to see come out is a chink in your armor. And addressing it will make a difference\nfor you in ways that you\u2019ll never be able to predict.\u201d"}
{"300": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nIt is unlikely that the programming needs to change drastically to address weaknesses, particularly for an affiliate\nor large group setting. Further, trying to tailor the program to every individual weakness is impossible. The best the\ntrainer can do is to observe and respond to the general trends in the gym and provide well-varied programming\nconsistently.\nConstant assessment is needed to ensure that too much capacity is not lost in the strong areas. When assessment\nhas shown that the weak areas are now at an acceptable level, the trainer should look to identify the next area\nof weakness and make small adjustments accordingly. A radical change in programming is likely to eliminate the\nbenefits experienced elsewhere (e.g., programming becomes too skewed toward the new goal).\nIf the programming becomes too skewed toward working on specific elements, then it is biased. Biasing is program-\nming certain elements more frequently regardless of current capacity in those areas. Biasing does not necessarily\nresult in an increase in fitness; it results in an increase in a specific capacity. Biasing is not necessarily negative if it\nserves the athlete\u2019s preference or goal. It is only a problem when the athlete is seeking general fitness and continues\nto follow a biased program. Addressing weaknesses may eventually become a bias in the absence of assessment.\nWeakness work can be easily included in the warm-up of the class, focusing on the technique of one of the more chal-\nlenging movements. This gives clients extra practice time to improve a deficiency and potentially allows for a more\n\u201cpersonalized\u201d program. During warm-up and skill sessions, which are often heavily biased toward newer and less\nproficient athletes, an effective trainer needs to also offer challenging options for the advanced athletes.\nFor example, suppose a trainer led a warm-up that included a skill session on pistols. Although most of the athletes\nmay be working on getting their first pistol, perhaps using a band or squatting to a box with a support, advanced\nathletes may be working on weighted pistols (e.g., with a bar in the overhead-squat position). There are examples of\nhow to use warm-ups to implement weakness work in the \u201cExample Warm-ups to Address Weaknesses\u201d section of\nthis training guide. With well-varied workouts, much of the warm-up can coincide with movement preparation for the\nworkout to practice elements that are usually weak (e.g., handstand push-ups, muscle-ups, double-unders).\nRegardless of the movements selected, trainers should be sure to avoid pre-fatiguing the client. The goal of the\nwarm-up is not to make it another workout. An example of a poor choice of warm-up may be doing three rounds of\n15 pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, and hip extensions before the workout Cindy (as many repetitions as possible\nin 20 minutes of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats). Pre-fatigue is of particular concern when a trainer plans\na longer skill session before the workout, such as handstand push-up skill work before the workout Diane (21-15-9\nrepetitions of deadlifts and handstand push-ups). Such skill work can be done, but the trainer must monitor the\nvolume such that the athletes are not unduly fatigued. Each athlete has variable tolerance to pre-workout volume\nrelative to that athlete\u2019s capacity. The tolerance builds over time, so the warm-up can eventually be more extensive\nwithout pre-fatiguing muscles.\nTemplates can be used for weakness work. They can help keep a coach or athlete committed to dedicating time to\nskill development. However, it is important for coaches and athletes to use their judgment to change or break from\nthe template as necessary.\nScaling effectively\nScaling workouts appropriately for one\u2019s clients is an essential consideration to best increase their fitness. This is not"}
{"301": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\njust a concept for beginner clients; an effective trainer progresses the most athletes toward completing workouts as\nprescribed across months and years.\nTo scale effectively, a trainer needs to review the original workout for its intended stimulus, including:\n\u2022 movement functions,\n\u2022 loading parameters,\n\u2022 time frame, and\n\u2022 volume of repetitions.\nThis does not have to be a formal process, but it helps identify appropriate scaling options.\nSuppose an affiliate decided to post the workout Amanda (9-7-5 repetitions of muscle-ups and 135-lb. snatches) for\nits daily classes. This is a workout most members at most affiliates have to scale. The basic analysis of the workout\nvariables shows:\n1. a high-skill gymnastics movement that is an upper-body pull and push and a high-skill weightlifting\nmovement that is predominantly a lower-body pull and squat,\n2. the intended loading is moderate,\n3. the intended time is short (approximately 5 minutes), and\n4. the volume is low.\nThe goal for scaling this workout is to adhere to as many of these variables as possible in light of the individual\u2019s\ncapacity. The resulting scaled workout still needs to provide each client with a significant challenge. There is no single\nstrategy that works in every situation. Scaling is also a \u201cmoving target\u201d as individual capacities change over time.\nThere are some populations for which a trainer can employ common scaling strategies:\n1. beginners and/or deconditioned individuals,\n2. intermediate athletes,\n3. advanced athletes, and\n4. injured athletes.\nScaling guidelines, and examples for the workout Amanda, are detailed below.\nBeginners and/or deconditioned individuals are generally those athletes who have been doing CrossFit for six months\nor less. For beginner and/or deconditioned individuals, a trainer needs to be primarily concerned with adherence to\nthe proper points of performance of the movements throughout the full range of motion. Increasing the difficulty\n(via movements or volume) and/or pushing for greater intensity (via speed or load) are secondary to developing\nmovement proficiency and new skill development. This group may often include the elderly, where additional safety\nconcerns may be necessary (e.g., keeping feet on the floor). Beginners need a lot of guidance: The trainer must be\nproactive about approaching them and modifying the workout.\nLoads, distances, and repetitions are the primary variables to modify during scaling, particularly before changing the\nmovement. If a movement is beyond the athlete\u2019s current abilities, a substitution should create a similar movement\nfunction and range of motion. In some cases, preserving function and range of motion can be done by using severa\nmovements to achieve a similar effect. Also, it is not \u201cstandard\u201d to increase the volume of the substituted or \u201cless"}
{"302": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nchallenging\u201d movement. For example, it is not necessary to always make those substituting single-unders for dou-\nble-unders complete two or three times the repetitions. This group often needs reduced volume, even with a substi-\ntuted movement.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for beginners/deconditioned individuals include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Reduce to whatever allows the athlete to best practice the movement with full range\nof motion. This may be a training bar, empty barbell, or even PVC pipe. If the athlete has to go very light\nto preserve movement mechanics, consider doubling the repetition scheme. This gives the athlete more\npractice repetitions, which is the primary concern for the inexperienced. It is also possible to reduce the\nrange of motion in a loaded scenario if the mechanics cannot otherwise be preserved. Regardless of the\nscaling choice, the workout should provide some challenge across the repetitions.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. Replace with a simple upper-body pull and push. Most likely, this will be jumping\npull-ups or ring rows, and squat-assisted dips, bench dips, or push-ups. These options are mechanically\nsimple relative to the muscle-up, so a trainer needs to pick an option that provides a challenge to the\nathlete\u2019s upper-body strength across the total repetitions.\nAlthough not an exact guideline, the term \u201cintermediate athletes\u201d generally describes those who have been doing\nCrossFit for six months to three years. An intermediate athlete is one who can perform some workouts as prescribed\nbut still struggles with more complex movements or challenging repetition schemes and loads. Scaling the repeti-\ntions on some gymnastics movements and the loads on some weightlifting movements is the main priority. A trainer\nmust be mindful that an intermediate athlete is best served by using different scaling options each time a particular\nmovement or load appears in a workout. A trainer can create several different options for intermediate athletes\nnot only to avoid boredom, but also to help them continue to develop their fitness. Varying the manner in which a\nworkout is scaled reduces the timeframe needed to acquire the desired adaptation.\nWith time, intermediate athletes should be able to adequately scale their own workouts. This comes with a better\nunderstanding of workout goals and their own strengths and weaknesses. Intermediate athletes may be incor-\nrectly neglected at times because they require less guidance than the beginner. Nevertheless, the majority of one\u2019s\nmembers will likely be intermediate athletes with a wide range of abilities. These athletes still need to be pushed to\nnew levels as appropriate.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for intermediate athletes include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Intermediate athletes often include individuals who should stay at the prescribed\nweight and potentially take longer to complete the workout. Although their power output may be lower\nthan if the load was scaled, keeping the load as prescribed helps develop exactly the strength and\nstamina needed to perform the workout in a more competitive time. In cases where this load would\nnot be completed in any realistic time frame (i.e., would take more than 20 minutes), reduce the load\nappropriately.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. The scale is best when it is specific to the weakness, and it therefore does not take\non one specific form. If they have significant upper-body capacity in pull-ups and dips, an effective scale\nwould be to work a transition drill, as that is where their capacity is lacking (i.e., working the transition\nhelps strengthen a greater range of motion at the shoulder). Conversely, an intermediate athlete who"}
{"303": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nstruggles with pull-ups and dips may be better served using those movements in the workout to develop\nthe pushing and pulling stamina and strength of the upper body. Depending on proficiency, perhaps the\nrepetitions of pull-ups and dips should be increased. If there is an athlete who has muscle-ups but is not\nconsistent with them or cannot perform a high volume, reducing the repetitions is a viable option to help\ntrain the skill in a mixed-modal environment (e.g., repetitions of 5-4-3).\nAdvanced-level athletes are those who can perform all workouts and movements as prescribed. Typically, these\nathletes either came to CrossFit after years of performing some functional movements at high intensities (e.g., col-\nlegiate gymnast) or they have been doing CrossFit consistently for years. There are times a trainer needs to scale\nthis athlete due to sickness, injury, personal problems, or a recent string of difficult/demanding workouts. Occasion-\nally suggesting a variation with lower loading and/or repetitions benefits the advanced athlete both physically and/\nor mentally.\nThere may be an occasion to \u201cscale up\u201d an individual if the athlete is not challenged by the repetition scheme or weight\nor is in need of a different stimulus for skill development. The obvious options are to increase load or repetitions\nchoose different equipment (dumbbells vs. barbells), or make a movement more difficult (parallette vs. regular hand-\nstand push-ups). A trainer needs to be wary of this practice and should avoid consistently making workouts heavier\nand higher in volume to provide a \u201cchallenge.\u201d More often than not, the advanced athlete needs to be coached to\nbetter movement mechanics and/or greater intensity before making a workout \u201charder.\u201d An effective trainer needs to\nfocus on fixing movement inefficiencies and pushing for faster speeds before increasing the weights and repetitions\nThese corrections translate to seconds of gain in performance.\nCoaches need to be sure not to confuse advanced for elite, where elite is reserved for individuals actually going to the\nGames. Competitive programming is outside the scope of this course, as well as outside the scope of most affiliate\nneeds. At a minimum, athletes should be considered advanced before more volume is needed.\nSome potential scaling options for an advanced athlete in Amanda are listed below. There are infinite ways to tweak\nthe workout based on needs and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the athlete. These would be good options\nparticularly when an advanced athlete already has a competitive Amanda time.\n\u2022 Snatch. The snatch may be made heavier, may become a power variation, may be replaced with heavy\ndumbbells, etc.\n\u2022 Muscle-up. The muscle-ups may become bar muscle-ups, strict muscle-ups, weighted muscle-ups,\nmuscle-ups to forward rolls, etc.\nThe fourth category of participants includes the injured athlete. These individuals should be encouraged to par-\nticipate in the workout, as there is benefit to training even in their reduced capacity. There is a positive hormona\nresponse from exercise, which can affect a multitude of factors, from body weight to recovery to mental state\nAlthough the nature of injury determines what is possible, the goal is still the same: to replicate all workout variables\nas closely as possible.\nPain-free range of motion is the main guideline. Where the movement cannot be performed exactly, a trainer should\nfind a substitute that best replicates the basic function and/or range of motion. However, any movement that stil\nrelies primarily on the injured joint/body part should be used cautiously, if at all. A trainer may need to get creative at\ntimes to help athletes avoid boredom and keep an injured athlete working for new skill acquisition."}
{"304": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nSingle-limb work can be utilized: Contrary to the belief that this results in a problematic muscular imbalance, exer-\ncising the non-injured side can reduce atrophy in the injured side. Dumbbells are a perfect tool for one-sided work\nand the number of repetitions can increase in cases where the loading is limited. However, this should not be the\nonly option for someone with an injured limb. If an exercise involves two movement functions, an athlete may stil\nbe able to perform one with both sides. For example, in a thruster, an athlete with an injured upper body might stil\nbe able to squat or front squat. If the athlete has an injured lower body, he or she might still be able to press or push\npress. If there are no reasonable options for an injured person to perform a similar movement, omit the movement\nor substitute something else. This should be the last option considered.\nUsing the workout Amanda as an example, scaling options for injured athletes would take on many different forms\ndepending on the injury. Here are a couple of examples:\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s shoulder is injured such that he or she cannot support any load with one arm.\nPotentially, the snatch becomes a heavy dumbbell snatch on the good side, or it could become a 135-lb.\nback squat; the load could even be increased to be more challenging in the 9-7-5 repetition scheme. The\nmuscle-up may become a single-arm ring row and push-up or dumbbell press.\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s knee is injured such that he or she has limited flexion. The snatch may become a\nsnatch variation (power, muscle, hang) depending on the range of motion of the knee. The muscle-up\nwould not have to be scaled.\nWhen the injured side is cleared to be used again, the trainer must increase intensity very gradually, with a heavy\nemphasis on maintaining optimal mechanics to prevent additional injuries.\nImplementing scaling in a class environment\nAfter a trainer has analyzed the workout and knows what is likely to need scaling (especially movement substitutions)\ndirection must be given to the entire class to help each individual to the appropriate modification. While this can be\ndifficult in a busy class setting, a lot of scaling confusion can be prevented when the trainer introduces the workout\nto the class by indicating the intended stimulus or goal of the workout. Loading, repetition, time, and movement\nconsiderations can be discussed.\nPresenting several scaling options at this time can help keep the class moving. Some gyms present set scaling options\nthat keep large groups organized. This is fine, but a trainer must also recognize that the best choice for some athletes\nmay be an entirely different option. An experienced trainer should have no problem creating unique scaling options\nas necessary without taking away from class instruction and group cohesion.\nThe trainer also needs to observe clients as they increase loads and practice the movements in preparation for the\nworkout. An effective trainer can quickly see if the movement loading and repetition scheme chosen for the workout\nare appropriate by watching warm-up sets. There are times when scaling may have been assessed incorrectly and\na trainer needs to scale after the workout has begun. If an athlete is struggling too early in the workout and will not\nachieve the desired outcome, the trainer needs to adjust one or more of the workout variables mid-workout (e.g.\nload, repetitions). This is mandatory if an athlete cannot maintain safe mechanics. In these instances, it is important\nthat the trainer is firm with his or her decision. If he or she has built a good rapport with athletes, they should have\nno problem with such adjustments."}
{"305": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nSport-specific preparation\nMany CrossFit trainers have some sport-specific athletes looking to incorporate CrossFit training into their regimen\nWhile sport-specific athletes cannot use CrossFit as a substitute for their sport-specific practice, fixing deficiencies in\ntheir general physical preparedness has immediate benefit within their sport. These carry-over benefits may not have\nobvious mechanical or metabolic explanations. For specialists at the advanced tier of their sport, there is a greater\nmargin to improve their performance by improving their general physical preparedness versus spending more time\nin sport-specific strength and conditioning training. Sport training and physiology are not so well understood that\nhighly specialized strength and conditioning routines are optimally effective, and CrossFit brings a com bination of\nadaptations that lead to improved performance.\nA CrossFit trainer needs to remember that he or she coaches CrossFit and should not attempt to mimic the sport\nwithin CrossFit workouts. A CrossFit trainer is not the athlete\u2019s swim, soccer, or tennis coach and should not attempt\nto coach beyond his or her knowledge. Doing so results in a trainer giving poor CrossFit training and poor sport-spe-\ncific training. The CrossFit trainer needs to program CrossFit for these sport-specific athletes, just as for their non-\nsport-specific clients. The sport practices and sport coaches will improve the specific skills needed on the field, in\na match, etc.\nCrossFit trainers need to be mindful of their athletes\u2019 competition seasons to be sure the volume of CrossFit is helping\nand not hurting an athlete\u2019s sport performance. CrossFit training is secondary to the sport training, particularly in\nseason. There is often a natural trade-off in volume between CrossFit and the sport training depending on the time of\nyear relative to the in-season period. This is to allow more time and energy for competition when seasonal demands\nare higher. This may not be necessary for all athletes in all sports. The general guideline is to add CrossFit volume\ncautiously while constantly assessing sport performance and being particularly cautious when an athlete is near in\ntime to an important event.\nPrograMMing ConsideraTions: CoMMon PiTfaLLs\nIf a programmer regularly assesses his or her athletes and observes the trends in data, he or she can quickly adjust\nineffective programming. Conversely, CrossFit programmers who do not regularly assess data can fall prey to\ncommon faults, some of which are described below.\n1. The first common error made by CrossFit programmers is a lack of regular assessment to determine\neffectiveness. Measurable results in performance markers are the guideposts for a programmer to\ndetermine whether the past programming was productive as well as what needs to be programmed next\nLack of assessment may occur from not repeating benchmark workouts and/or not recording results\nTrainers need to encourage members to record results to assist with this effort. Clients generally like this\nrecord of progress, particularly after months and years of hard work.\n2. Another error for CrossFit programmers occurs when variance is not applied correctly, and this is usually\nexpressed in one of three ways: randomization of workout variables, biasing certain variables, or emphasizing\nnon-essential elements. As mentioned above, optimal variance of workout variables requires intentiona\nplanning, not merely spinning the hopper and pulling out random tasks. A hopper may be used as a good\ntest of fitness (i.e., is an athlete ready for anything?), but it is not a good method to prepare for everything\nReliance on the hopper would leave to chance the broad, general, and inclusive adaptations CrossFit is"}
{"306": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\ntrying to develop. Programming via a hopper may be fun once in a while and can be used occasionally in\ncompetitions, but it is not a method by which to program for the best results.\nBiasing occurs when certain elements or combinations are repeated too often, with some elements avoided\ncompletely. There is nothing inherently bad about biasing as long as that is the intended goal. Biasing is a prob-\nlem if the goal is to develop general physical preparedness.\nAnother misapplication of variance is emphasizing non-essential elements. This appears as an endless\ncombination of workout variables, regardless of their utility or effect. For example, never repeating work-\nouts, performing lots of accessory or skill movements in actual workouts (e.g., Sots presses, single-leg work\nsport-specific drills), or focusing too much on environmental factors (e.g., working out with a gas mask or in the\nmiddle of the night) can be signs that variance is being misapplied. It can be easy for newer programmers to\nbelieve \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d programming provides a superior stimulus because of the novelty.\n3. A third common error in CrossFit programming is a lack of higher-skill development. This can occur when\ncertain movements are avoided in workouts or when warm-ups are not used to address weaknesses. A\ncurrent trend within the community is to avoid the more difficult gymnastics movements. CrossFit athletes\nare willing to tackle the technical weightlifting movements such as the snatch and clean and jerk but do not\nspend as much time developing the more technical counterparts in gymnastics, such as levers, planches\npresses to handstands, or pirouettes.\n4. CrossFit programmers may be tempted to use excessive volume. This occurs with more than one training\nsession a day (i.e., double days). In some cases, athletes may even attempt more than two sessions. This\npitfall affects those trying to emulate the volume sometimes used by CrossFit Games athletes. Games\nathletes\u2019 training is not representative of what CrossFit programming should look like. Multiple sessions a\nday are not appropriate for 99 percent of CrossFit athletes (less than one percent of those who participate\nin the Open go to the Games). Even multiple workouts in one extended \u201csession\u201d should generally be\navoided. Extra sessions and/or extra workouts may help performance in the short term but often lead to\novertraining, higher risk of injury, and burnout in the long term. Double days help Games athletes prepare\nfor high-volume competition and can help them get in more volume so they can advance certain skills\nrelative to their competitors. Generally, however, there is actually a decrease in intensity across sessions. As\nCoach Glassman said, \u201cBe impressed by intensity, not volume.\u201d If a client is looking to be competitive, very\ngradually and cautiously increase volume. For example, start with additional skill sessions (e.g., double-\nunder practice) in areas in which the athlete is not as proficient, not multiple workouts. Look at CrossFit\ncom and assess what the athlete cannot complete, then add \u201cvolume\u201d by way of working on these skills. The\nvolume should gradually increase over the long term.\n5. Another trickle-down effect from the Games is the assumption that the \u201cCrossFit standard\u201d for a movement\nis what is performed at the CrossFit Games. Standards in competition are set for ease of judging and do\nnot necessarily represent the best expression of the movement. They are used to establish the minimum\nrequirements for a repetition, and an athlete is held to those standards to ensure the range of motion is\nthe same across all competitors. Take, for example, hand-release push-ups: There is nothing better about\nthem in terms of muscular development or mechanical advantage. They are used because they are easier"}
{"307": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nto judge; a judge can easily ensure the chest and thighs make contact with the ground on every single\nrepetition. Standards in competitions should not prevent an athlete from using (or a trainer from teaching)\nmany different movement mechanics to develop a broad athletic capacity. There are different adaptations\nto all movements, and variations at the very least improve the overall coordination of an athlete who can\naccomplish a single task in multiple ways. CrossFit encourages athletes to learn all possible techniques and\nnot a single \u201cstandard\u201d (e.g., strict, chest-to-bar, kipping, and butterfly kipping pull-ups). This is another face\nof variance needed to develop the athletic capacity to accomplish tasks in multiple ways, and it is what wil\nbest prepare one for any test of fitness.\nConCLusion\nEffective programming occurs by applying basic tenets when selecting workout elements and combinations\nOptimizing long-term program design is best guided by observing results (i.e., objective and measurable change\nin performance markers) and applying focused weakness work or appropriate scaling. The elements of the daily\nworkouts are but one factor that affects how well an individual optimizes his or her fitness.

{"314": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nCLASS STRUCTURE AND LESSON PLANNING\nDuring the Level 2 Course, participants are led through a mock class from start to finish. It is meant to serve as a basic\nclass template for CrossFit affiliates. Although each example class at the Level 2 course is different\u2014from instructors\nto warm-up drills to workouts\u2014universally, there are themes that represent effective coaching practices.\nBeing a trainer is not about showing up, quickly writing a last-minute workout at the whiteboard, and turning on the\nmusic. Real training is about improving each client\u2019s fitness (and by association quality of life) in small, incremental\nsteps in a motivating and positive way. Besides having the presence, attitude, and demonstration skills to develop a\npositive rapport with one\u2019s clients (see \u201cFoundations of Effective Training\u201d), a large part of improving client fitness is\nhaving a plan, both on a day-to-day and long-term basis. This section discusses the basic but necessary components\na trainer needs to run a single class.\nTo effectively manage time, trainers need to have a lesson plan. A single class can be outlined as a four-part lesson\nplan consisting of:\n\u2022 Introduction\n\u2022 Warm-Up\n\u2022 Workout\n\u2022 Post-Workout\nThe total time of the workout helps set the allotted time for the warm-up and cool-down sections. A longer workout\nmeans sacrificing time in either or both. Most affiliates run hour-long classes, and this is the length used in the Level\n2 example class.\nLogistical considerations affect an appropriate workout to select, as well as the time allotted to each component of\nthe class. Factors include gear availability, class size, gym space (for equipment and athlete layout), and the expe-\nrience level of the class. A trainer needs to consider various alternatives because additional modifications may be\nnecessary on the fly, depending on the experience level of the clients and how many show up. For example, if the\naffiliate has limited floor space, it will not take many participants to make it cramped. For safety considerations, a\ntrainer needs to ensure there are walkable areas between all moving athletes and their equipment. Dumbbells are\na phenomenal tool for athletes; they are great space savers, as well as substitutes for barbells in many scenarios.\nTrainers may also use sandbags, the outdoors, staggered heats, etc. Trainers are limited only by their knowledge\nand creativity.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction, although the shortest element of a class, is of great importance. During the introduction\n(commonly referred to as the time \u201cat the whiteboard\u201d), the coach will brief the workout, set expectations by explain-\ning the intended stimulus, offer several scaling options, and take any questions. Generally, the introduction will take\nbetween two and four minutes, depending on the complexity of the workout and the number of participants taking\nclass. Having more participants increases the likelihood of questions. The introduction should serve to clear up any\nconfusion about the workout while also reducing pre-workout anxiety."}
{"315": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nWarm-up\nThe purpose of the warm-up is to do just that: warm the body in preparation for intense activity. Warm-ups often\nconsist of two parts: a general warm-up and a specific warm-up. The main goal of a general warm-up is to stimulate\nthe body\u2019s physiological functions\u2014i.e., increase core temperature and blood flow to the muscles, prime the car-\ndiorespiratory system, increase mobility, and move joints through a full range of motion. General warm-ups usually\ninclude calisthenic-type movements or movements that involve dynamic ranges of motion.\nThe primary goals of a specific warm-up are to build, practice, and refine proper mechanics for the movements that\nwill be used in the workout, and to prepare mentally and physically for the challenge. Specific warm-ups present an\nopportunity for movement assessment and appropriate scaling. However, potentially different ranges of motion\nand/or variations may be used (e.g., power vs. squat variations, medicine balls vs. barbells) where necessary.\nMovements that are not part of the workout may also be used in the warm-up, as the warm-up element also provides\nan opportunity to improve deficiencies in any movements (i.e., practicing handstands even though handstands may\nnot be in the workout). Typically, these options are reserved for shorter, lower-skill workouts that do not require a\nsignificant amount of time to prepare for (i.e., rowing 1,000 meters for time or running a timed mile). The \u201cProgram\nDesign and Scaling\u201d article discusses how to use this time as focused weakness work.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and coach in the warm-up period. The warm-up helps athletes best prepare\nto handle the demands of the workout and improve upon deficiencies, whether they are subtle mechanical ineffi-\nciencies in more experienced athletes or larger faults in movements with which athletes have little experience. The\nwarm-up also provides the trainer with an opportunity to assess the athletic capacity of an individual relative to\nthe intended stimulus. Following the assessment/practice period, it is time for the trainer to assign scaling options\nAlthough the trainer should have some ideas before starting a class, it isn\u2019t until after actually assessing athletes\nneeds that a trainer can choose the most effective option(s). As discussed in the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article\nscaling should progress with the athletes, and they should be constantly challenged (i.e., they should not just perform\nthe same scale every time a movement, rep range, or prescribed load is outside their current capacity). Beyond\nassessment and scaling, the warm-up is also the time for the coach to mentally prepare the athletes and oversee any\nremaining workout logistics (e.g., equipment distribution, equipment layout, heats, safety checks).\nA pre-workout break is not one of the main elements of a lesson plan, but it is needed and useful for a coach. The\npre-workout break includes safety and equipment checks, room layout, workout flow, additional scaling, questions\nfrom the athletes, a bathroom opportunity, and of course, the workout re-brief.\nThe workout re-brief is there to remind the athletes what the workout is (order of movements, repetition scheme\nand rounds or time) and the range-of-motion standards that are required. A coach needs to clearly demonstrate and\nemphasize the range of motion and mechanics for every movement before every single workout. This makes it easier\nto hold athletes to these standards during the workout and cultivate a culture of virtuosity in one\u2019s gym.\nWe must remember, especially for newer athletes, workout abbreviations and acronyms on the whiteboard are not\nself-evident. A coach may choose to discuss scaling options with the entire class at this time or even review the\nintended stimulus of the workout. This could potentially include describing the targeted time domain, loading, or skil\nacquisition. For example, the workout Elizabeth (21-15-9 repetitions of cleans at 135 lb. and ring dips) is a relatively\nshort workout (about 5 min.), with moderate loading. Novice CrossFit athletes likely have to reduce the load for the"}
{"316": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nclean to their level of moderate loading (e.g., 95 lb.), and they might have to address the dips\u2019 load (e.g., band, bench)\nor volume (e.g., 12-9-6) to best match the original workout intent. See the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article for\nmore information about preserving the intended stimulus.\nWhether in the pre-workout brief or the specific warm-up, time should be allotted for athletes to practice the exact\nstandards to be used in the workout. If the movement is loaded, additional time is needed for athletes to work up to\nan appropriate load under the discretion of the trainer.\nWorkout\nOnce the workout begins, the demands on a coach\u2019s abilities increase. Coaching is not about repetition counting\ncheering, or selecting music. It is about appropriately applying threshold training, which means pushing an athlete\u2019s\nintensity while maintaining sound mechanics. This balance is what helps minimize the risk for injury but also keeps\nthe intensity high to drive progress. Deviations in mechanics are inevitable as athletes try to move fast to complete\nthe workout. A coach must attend to each client, using as many different cueing strategies as possible or needed\nand offering encouragement and reinforcement of sound mechanics throughout the workout. A coach may find that\nhe or she actually has to slow an athlete down and/or lower the load, as well as potentially stop them, if there is no\nimprovement in mechanics across multiple repetitions. Movement change is not reserved only for the warm-up. It\nmust continue throughout the workout. A coach is expected to make athletes better during the workout.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and the coach during the workout. The athlete will receive increased fitness\nadaptations from appropriately increasing speed and load. In addition, he or she should be receiving feedback from\nthe coach on how to improve and refine movement. The coach benefits in this scenario by learning and developing\nseeing and correcting skills in a faster, more dynamic, and less-controlled environment. The ability to deliver action-\nable and effective cues for better movement improves with experience while coaching under high intensity. It is a\npractical, real-time learning opportunity that is focused on effective coaching strategies related to both the athlete\u2019s\nmechanics and motivation.\nPost-workout\nThe main purpose of the post-workout element is to cool down the athletes and program items that will aid in\nrecovery, regaining mental acuity, slowing heart rates and breathing, and facilitating full range of motion about the\njoints (i.e., regaining homeostasis). The coach may also have some secondary goals for this period, such as additiona\nskill work, fitness challenges, education for the athlete, and preparation of the space for the next class. Regardless\na well-conducted post-workout session must include a proper cool-down that leaves clients prepared for the rest of\ntheir day, capable and eager to return and full of appreciation for their accomplishments.\nSome examples of possible cool-down elements are described below. Generally, the cool-down should begin by just\nallowing the athletes to recover for a few minutes. While the athletes are warm and pliable, the cool-down is an excel-\nlent time to stretch or foam roll, especially the areas that were taxed heavily. This can aid recovery, reducing soreness\nwhile potentially helping athletes to gain new range of motion. A coach may leave this as an open period, allowing\nmembers to choose which drills are best for them. A coach-led session, however, ensures everyone has direction\nattention, motivation, and a sense of togetherness.\nA trainer may choose to include skill work at the end of a workout. This can include a review of the movements\nused, especially to correct errors that may have presented themselves during the workout. Using reduced speed and"}
{"317": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nload, the trainer can reinforce sound movement mechanics before the athlete leaves. If a trainer filmed an athlete\u2019s\nmovement during the workout, this period can include video playback to review his or her technique. It is also possible\nto work on a totally unrelated skill. While practice is more difficult after a workout due to fatigue, this is precisely why\nattempting new skills here can be beneficial (heightened neurological adaptations due to muscular fatigue).\nA post-workout may include a finisher\u2014an impromptu fitness test such as a maximum set of pull-ups, handstand\nwalking, or rope climbs\u2014anything. It can be part of an ongoing record or a competition, and it can be used as a moti-\nvational event or a chance to reinforce the unknown and unknowable nature of life\u2019s challenges. For example, finish-\ners may be grouped into teams or partners, or the challenge may be structured so one or two athletes compete at a\ntime and the rest of the class can cheer. As in a warm-up, a coach needs to be mindful that finishers do not become\na second workout, nor do they have to be part of every class.\nA coach can use the post-workout period to ensure athletes are recording their workouts. Especially on benchmark\ndays (including strength days), the coach should encourage members to write down their times, repetitions, loads\nand scaling or modifications. The coach should also be able to tell the members the last date the workout was com-\npleted for comparison.\nFinally, a coach can use this time as an educational opportunity to talk about nutrition, programming, scaling, \u201cWhat\nIs Fitness?\u201d or \u201cWhat is CrossFit?\u201d etc., all with the intention of creating smarter athletes.\nThe post-workout/cool-down period gives the coach time to survey athletes and look for mental faculties and visible\nsigns of injury or physical distress. A coach needs to pay attention to verbal and nonverbal cues that an athlete may\nbe under duress. This is also a time for the coach to engage in conversation with athletes by offering encouragement\nand feedback on performance and asking about their physical responses to the workout. Such conversations provide\nvaluable information about the coach\u2019s or facility\u2019s programming. These small connections also lay the groundwork\nfor building a strong community and meaningful relationships with one\u2019s members. The post-workout period is an\noften overlooked or rushed section of class, but it is valuable time, and a coach should use it wisely.\nTo be effective in each class, not only does a coach have to have capacity in all six areas discussed in the \u201cFoundations\nof Effective Training\u201d article, but one must also have a plan. This plan covers all aspects of the class to best improve\none\u2019s athletes with each training session while keeping them safe and excited to return for the next day. After each\nsession, an informal review and critique of one\u2019s own class performance can help the coach better prepare for sub-\nsequent sessions. Self-awareness and critique are critical to development.\nExample lesson plans and scaling options for two workouts are presented on the following pages."}

{"4": "UNDERSTANDING CROSSFIT\nOriginally published in April 2007.\nThe aims, prescription, methodology, implementation, and adaptations of Cross-\nFit are collectively and individually unique, defining of CrossFit, and instrumental\nin our program\u2019s successes in diverse applications.\nAIMS\nFrom the beginning, the aim of CrossFit has been to forge a broad, general, and in-\nclusive fitness. We sought to build a program that would best prepare trainees for\nany physical contingency\u2014prepare them not only for the unknown but for the un-\nknowable. Looking at all sport and physical tasks collectively, we asked what physi-\ncal skills and adaptations would most universally lend themselves to performance\nadvantage. Capacity culled from the intersection of all sports demands would\nquite logically lend itself well to all sport. In sum, our specialty is not specializing.\nPRESCRIPTION\nCrossFit is: \u201cconstantly varied, high-intensity functional movement.\u201d This is our\nprescription. Functional movements are universal motor recruitment patterns;\nthey are performed in a wave of contraction from core to extremity; and they are\ncompound movements\u2014i.e., they are multi-joint. They are natural, effective, and\nefficient locomotors of body and external objects. But no aspect of functional\nmovements is more important than their capacity to move large loads over long\ndistances, and to do so quickly. Collectively, these three attributes (load, distance,\nand speed) uniquely qualify functional movements for the production of high pow-\ner. Intensity is defined exactly as power, and intensity is the independent variable\nmost commonly associated with maximizing the rate of return of favorable adap-\ntation to exercise. Recognizing that the breadth and depth of a program\u2019s stimulus\nwill determine the breadth and depth of the adaptation it elicits, our prescription\nof functionality and intensity is constantly varied. We believe that preparation for\nrandom physical challenges\u2014i.e., unknown and unknowable events\u2014is at odds\nwith fixed, predictable, and routine regimens."}
{"5": "METHODOLOGY\nThe methodology that drives CrossFit is entirely empirical. We believe that mean-\ningful statements about safety, efficacy, and efficiency, the three most important\nand interdependent facets to evaluate any fitness program, can be supported only\nby measurable, observable, repeatable data. We call this approach \u201cevidence-based\nfitness.\u201d CrossFit\u2019s methodology depends on full disclosure of methods, results,\nand criticisms, and we have employed the internet to support these values. Our\ncharter is open source, making co-developers out of participating coaches, ath-\nletes, and trainers through a spontaneous and collaborative online community.\nCrossFit is empirically driven, clinically tested, and community developed.\nIMPLEMENTATION We\u2019ve take\nIn implementation, CrossFit is, quite simply, a sport\u2014the Sport of Fitness.

{"8": "Aside from the breadth or totality of fitness CrossFit seeks, our program is dis-\ntinctive, if not unique, in its focus on maximizing neuroendocrine response, de-\nveloping power, cross-training with multiple training modalities, constant training\nand practice with functional movements, and the development of successful\ndiet strategies.\nOur athletes are trained to bike, run, swim, and row at short, middle, and long\ndistances, guaranteeing exposure and competency in each of the three main met-\nabolic pathways.\nWe train our athletes in gymnastics from rudimentary to advanced movements,\ngarnering great capacity at controlling the body both dynamically and statically\nwhile maximizing strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility. We also place a heavy\nemphasis on Olympic weightlifting, having seen this sport\u2019s unique ability to devel-\nop an athlete\u2019s explosive power, control of external objects, and mastery of critical\nmotor recruitment patterns. And finally we encourage and assist our athletes to\nexplore a variety of sports as a vehicle to express and apply their fitness.\nAN EFFECTIVE APPROACH\nIn gyms and health clubs throughout the world the typical workout consists of\nisolation movements and extended aerobic sessions. The fitness community from\ntrainers to the magazines has the exercising public believing that lateral raises,\ncurls, leg extensions, sit-ups and the like combined with 20- to 40-minute stints on\nthe stationary bike or treadmill are going to lead to some kind of great fitness. Well,\nat CrossFit we work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high-in-\ntensity cardiovascular sessions. We have replaced the lateral raise with the push\npress, the curl with the pull-up, and the leg extension with the squat. For every\nlong-distance effort our athletes will do five or six at short distance. Why? Because\nfunctional movements and high intensity are radically more effective at eliciting\nnearly any desired fitness result. Startlingly, this is not a matter of opinion but\nsolid, irrefutable scientific fact, and yet the marginally effective old ways persist\nand are nearly universal. Our approach is consistent with what is practiced in elite"}
{"9": "training programs associated with major university athletic teams and profession-\nal sports. CrossFit endeavors to bring state-of-the-art coaching techniques to the\ngeneral public and athlete.\nIS THIS FOR ME?\nAbsolutely! Your needs and the Olympic athlete\u2019s differ by degree not kind. In-\ncreased power, speed, strength, cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, flexibility,\nstamina, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy are each important to the\nworld\u2019s best athletes and to our grandparents. The amazing truth is that the very\nsame methods that elicit optimal response in the Olympic or professional athlete\nwill optimize the same response in the elderly. Of course, we cannot load your\ngrandmother with the same squatting weight that we would assign an Olympic\nskier, but they both need to squat. In fact, squatting is essential to maintaining\nfunctional independence and improving fitness. Squatting is just one example\nof a movement that is universally valuable and essential yet rarely taught to any\nbut the most advanced of athletes. This is a tragedy. Through painstakingly thor-\nough coaching and incremental load assignment, CrossFit has been able to teach\neveryone who can care for himself or herself to perform safe-\nly and with maximum efficacy the same movements typically\nutilized by professional coaches in elite and certainly exclusive\nenvironments.\nWHO HAS BENEFITED FROM CROSSFIT?\nMany professional and elite athletes are participating in CrossFit.\nPrizefighters, cyclists, surfers, skiers, tennis players, triathletes\nand others competing at the highest levels are using CrossFit to\nadvance their core strength and conditioning, but that is not all.\nCrossFit has tested its methods on the sedentary, overweight,\npathological, and elderly and found that these special popula-\ntions met the same success as our stable of athletes. We call this\n\u201cbracketing.\u201d If our program works for Olympic skiers and over-\nweight, sedentary homemakers then it will work for you."}
{"10": "JUST WHAT IS A \u201cCORE STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING\u201d PROGRAM?\nCrossFit is a core strength and conditioning program in two distinct senses. First,\nwe are a core strength and conditioning program in the sense that the fitness\nwe develop is foundational to all other athletic\nneeds. This is the same sense in which the uni-\nversity courses required of a particular major\nare called the \u201ccore curriculum.\u201d This is the stuff\nthat everyone needs. Second, we are a \u201ccore\u201d\nstrength and conditioning program in the literal\nsense meaning the center of something. Much\nof our work focuses on the major functional axis\nof the human body, the extension and flexion\nof the hips and torso or trunk. The primacy of\ncore strength and conditioning in this sense is\nsupported by the simple observation that pow-\nerful hip extension alone is necessary and near-\nly sufficient for elite athletic performance. That\nis, our experience has been that no one without\nthe capacity for powerful hip extension enjoys\ngreat athletic prowess and nearly everyone we\nhave met with that capacity was a great athlete.\nRunning, jumping, punching, and throwing all\noriginate at the core. At CrossFit we endeavor\nto develop our athletes from the inside out, from core to extremity, which is, by\nthe way, how good functional movements recruit muscle, from the core to the\nextremities.\nCAN I ENJOY OPTIMAL HEALTH WITHOUT BEING AN ATHLETE?\nNo! Athletes experience a protection from the ravages of aging and disease that\nnon-athletes never find. For instance, 80-year-old athletes are stronger than\nnon-athletes in their prime at 25 years old. If you think that strength is not import-\nant, consider that strength loss is what puts people in nursing homes. Athletes\nhave greater bone density, stronger immune systems, less coronary heart dis-"}
{"11": "WHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO BE AN ATHLETE; I JUST WANT TO BE HEALTHY?\nYou are in luck. We hear this often, but the truth is that fitness, wellness, and pa-\nthology (sickness) are measures of the same entity: your health. There are a mul-\ntitude of measurable parameters that can be ordered from sick (pathological) to\nwell (normal) to fit (better than normal). These include but are not limited to blood\npressure, cholesterol, heart rate, body fat, muscle mass, flexibility, and strength.\nIt seems as though all of the body functions that can go awry have states that are\npathological, normal, and exceptional and that elite athletes typically show these\nparameters in the exceptional range. CrossFit\u2019s view is that fitness and health are\nthe same thing (see \u201cWhat Is Fitness? (Part 1)\u201d article). It is also interesting to notice\nthat the health professional maintains your health with drugs and surgery, each\nwith potentially undesirable side effects, whereas the CrossFit trainer typically\nachieves a superior result always with \u201cside benefit\u201d versus side effect.\nEXAMPLES OF CROSSFIT EXERCISES\nBiking, running, swimming, and rowing in an endless variety of drills. The clean and\njerk, snatch, squat, deadlift, push press, bench press, and power clean. Jumping,\nmedicine-ball throws and catches, pull-ups, dips, push-ups, handstands, presses\nto handstands, pirouettes, kips, cartwheels, muscle-ups, sit-ups, scales, and holds.\nWe make regular use of bikes, the track, rowing shells and ergometers, Olympic\nweight sets, rings, parallel bars, free exercise mats, horizontal bars, plyometrics\nboxes, medicine balls, and jump ropes.\nThere is not a strength and conditioning program anywhere that works with a\ngreater diversity of tools, modalities, and drills.\nWHAT IF I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF THIS?\nIt is a common sentiment to feel that because of the obligations of career and fami-\nly that you do not have the time to become as fit as you might like. Here is the good\nnews: World-class age group strength and conditioning is obtainable through an\nhour a day six days per week of training. It turns out that the intensity of training\nthat optimizes physical conditioning is not sustainable past 45 minutes to an hour.\nAthletes who train for hours a day are developing skill or training for sports that in-"}
{"12": "physical skills (cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, flexibility, strength,\npower, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy). The excessive aero-\nbic volume of the endurance athletes\u2019 training costs them in speed, power, and\nstrength to the point that their athletic competency has been compromised. No\ntriathlete is in ideal shape to wrestle, box, pole-vault, sprint, play any ball sport,\nfight fires, or do police work. Each of these requires a fitness level far beyond the\nneeds of the endurance athlete. None of this suggests that being a marathoner,\ntriathlete or other endurance athlete is a bad thing; just do not believe that training\nas a long-distance athlete gives you the fitness that is prerequisite to many sports.\nCrossFit considers the sumo wrestler, triathlete, marathoner, and powerlifter to\nbe \u201cfringe athletes\u201d in that their fitness demands are so specialized as to be incon-\nsistent with the adaptations that give maximum competency at all physical chal-\nlenges. Elite strength and conditioning is a compromise between each of the 10\nphysical adaptations. Endurance athletes do not balance that compromise.\nAEROBICS AND ANAEROBICS\nThere are three main energy systems that fuel all human activity. Almost all chang-\nes that occur in the body due to exercise are related to the demands placed on\nthese energy systems. Furthermore, the efficacy of any given fitness regimen may\nlargely be tied to its ability to elicit an adequate stimulus for change within these\nthree energy systems.\nEnergy is derived aerobically when oxygen is utilized to metabolize substrates de-\nrived from food and liberates energy. An activity is termed aerobic when the ma-\njority of energy needed is derived aerobically. These activities are usually greater\nthan 90 seconds in duration and involve low to moderate power output or inten-\nsity. Examples of aerobic activity include running on the treadmill for 20 minutes,\nswimming a mile, and watching TV.\nEnergy is derived anaerobically when energy is liberated from substrates in the\nabsence of oxygen. Activities are considered anaerobic when the majority of the\nenergy needed is derived anaerobically. In fact, properly structured, anaerobic ac-\ntivity can be used to develop a very high level of aerobic fitness without the muscle"}
{"13": "It warrants mention that in any activity all three energy systems are utilized\nthough one may dominate. The interplay of these systems can be complex, yet a\nsimple examination of the characteristics of aerobic versus anaerobic training can\nprove useful.\nCrossFit\u2019s approach is to judiciously balance anaerobic and aerobic exercise in a\nmanner that is consistent with the athlete\u2019s goals. Our exercise prescriptions ad-\nhere to proper specificity, progression, variation, and recovery to optimize\nadaptations.\nTHE OLYMPIC LIFTS, A.K.A., WEIGHTLIFTING\nThere are two Olympic lifts, the clean and jerk and\nthe snatch. Mastery of these lifts develops the\nsquat, deadlift, power clean, and split jerk while\nintegrating them into a single movement of un-\nequaled value in all of strength and conditioning.\nThe Olympic lifters are without a doubt the world\u2019s\nstrongest athletes.\nThese lifts train athletes to effectively activate more\nmuscle fibers more rapidly than through any other\nmodality of training. The explosiveness that results\nfrom this training is of vital necessity to every sport.\nPracticing the Olympic lifts teaches one to apply\nforce to muscle groups in proper sequence; i.e.,\nfrom the center of the body to its extremities (core\nto extremity). Learning this vital technical lesson benefits all athletes who need\nto impart force to another person or object, as is commonly required in near-\nly all sports.\nIn addition to learning to impart explosive forces, the clean and jerk and snatch\ncondition the body to receive such forces from another moving body both safely"}
{"14": "GYMNASTICS\nThe extraordinary value of gymnastics as a training modality lies in its reliance on\nthe body\u2019s own weight as the sole source of resistance. This places a unique premi-\num on the improvement of strength-to-weight ratio. Unlike other strength training\nmodalities, gymnastics and calisthenics allow for increases in strength only while\nincreasing strength-to-weight ratio!\nGymnastics develops pull-ups, squats, lunges, jumping, push-ups, and numerous\npresses to handstand, scales, and holds. These skills are unrivaled in their benefit\nto the physique, as evident in any competitive gymnast.\nAs important as the capacity of this modality is for strength development, it is with-\nout a doubt the ultimate approach to improving coordination, balance, agility, ac-\ncuracy, and flexibility. Through the use of numerous presses, handstands, scales,\nand other floor work, the gymnast\u2019s training greatly enhances kinesthetic sense.\nThe variety of movements available for inclusion in this modality probably exceeds\nthe number of exercises known to all non-gymnastic sport! The rich variety here\ncontributes substantially to CrossFit\u2019s ability to inspire great athletic confidence\nand prowess.\nFor a combination of strength, flexibility, well-developed physique, coordina-\ntion, balance, accuracy, and agility, the gymnast has no equal in the sports world.\nThe inclusion of this training modality is absurdly absent from nearly all train-\ning programs.\nROUTINES\nThere is no ideal routine! In fact, the chief value of any routine lies in abandon-\ning it for another. The CrossFit ideal is to train for any contingency. The obvious\nimplication is that this is possible only if there is a tremendously varied quality to\nthe breadth of stimulus. It is in this sense that CrossFit is a core strength and con-\nditioning program. Anything else is sport-specific training, not core strength and\nconditioning."}

{"18": "WHAT SHOULD I EAT?\nIn plain language, base your diet on garden vegetables (especially greens), meats,\nnuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar. That is about as simple as we\ncan get. Many have observed that keeping your grocery cart to the perimeter of the\ngrocery store while avoiding the aisles is a great way to protect your health.

The caveman model is perfect-\nly consistent with CrossFit\u2019s prescription.\nWHAT FOODS SHOULD I AVOID?\nExcessive consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates is the primary culprit in\nnutritionally caused health problems. High-glycemic carbohydrates are those that\nraise blood sugar too rapidly. They include rice, bread, candy, potato, sweets, so-\ndas, and most processed carbohydrates. Processing can include bleaching, bak-\ning, grinding, and refining. Processing of carbohydrates greatly increases their\nglycemic index, a measure of their propensity to elevate blood sugar.\nWHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH HIGH-GLYCEMIC CARBOHYDRATES?\nThe problem with high-glycemic carbohydrates is that in excess they give an inor-\ndinate insulin response.

Sport is the application of fitness in a fan-\ntastic atmosphere of competition and mastery.

It is, after all, the com-\nbined expression, or application, of the 10 general skills that is our motivation for\ntheir development in the first place. Sports and games like soccer, martial arts,\nbaseball, and basketball, in contrast to our training workouts, have more varied\nand less predictable movements. But, where sports develop and require all 10\ngeneral skills simultaneously, they do so slowly compared to our strength and con-\nditioning regimen. Sport is better, in our view, at expression and testing of skills\nthan it is at developing these same skills. Both expression and development are\ncrucial to our fitness.

They gave rea-\nsonable definitions to each of these 10 so that they seemed fairly distinct. Keep\nin mind, however, nature has no obligation to recognize these distinctions.

{"36": "We have countless examples of this from amateur and professional sports. At the\nheart of this is that we have learned some things about GPP that the world never\nknew before. There is more opportunity of advancing athletic performance via\nadvancing GPP than there is in more sport-specific strength and conditioning\ntraining. For example, I am not sure why more pull-ups make for better skiers,\nbut they do. We have some theories why that occurs, but we do not actually need\nto know the mechanism. We are focused on advancing performance.\nSo the second model is a statistical model using skills and drills. I am looking for a\nbalance of capacity across training modalities.\nThe third model uses the three metabolic pathways. These are the three engines\nthat produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the currency of effort of all energy\noutput. Power is plotted on the Y-axis and duration of effort (time) on the X-axis.\nThe first pathway (phosphagen or phosphocreatine) is high powered and short\nduration. It can account for about 100 percent of max human output and taps out\nat about 10 seconds. The second pathway (lactate or glycolytic) is moderate pow-\nered, moderate duration. It accounts for approximately 70 percent of max pow-\ner output, peaks at about 60 seconds and terminates at 120 seconds. The third\npathway (oxidative or aerobic) is low powered, long duration. It accounts for ap-\nproximately 40 percent of max power output and does not fade in any reasonable\ntime for which I have the patience to measure. The phosphagen and the glycolytic\npathways are anaerobic; oxidative is aerobic. All three engines work all the time to\nsome extent. The degree to which each is active is dependent on the activity. One\nidles, while the other two rev; two will rev, one will idle, etc.\nOur thought is this: He or she is as fit as he or she is balanced in capacity in all\nthree of these engines. A human being is a vehicle with three engines. Suppose we\ndiscover there is a fourth engine; we want capacity there, too. We develop capacity\nin all engines through our prescription: constantly varied functional movement\nexecuted at high intensity.

Then go back to the thrusters\nfor 15 repetitions, 15 pull-ups, 9 of each, stop the clock, and we get a total time\nfor the effort.\nPower is force times distance (work) divided by time. The work required to do Fran\nis constant (force times distance). It does not change unless your height changes\n(distance), the distance we travel (the movement\u2019s range of motion) changes, the\nload changes (95 lb.), or your weight changes. This means that every time you do\nFran or a specific benchmark workout, the work is constant.\nSo, you do Fran for the first time and have a Time 1 for it (T1). If you do it a year lat-\ner, the same work was completed but you have a separate time (T2). In comparing\nthe two efforts, we find that the work quantity cancels and the difference in time\nis the difference in power produced (Table 1).\nThere will be measurement error in this calculation. I can measure the force/\nweight with a scale, the distance traveled with a tape measure, and time with a\nwatch. There is not a lot of error therein, but there are some concerns as we are\ncalculating the body\u2019s displacement by using the center of mass, for example.\nHowever, as long as the work is constant, the same error occurs with every effort.\nAnd in comparison from one effort to the next, the errors cancel each other out\n(zero order error). This ratio of time (T2/T1) describes my progress to the accuracy\nand precision of the watch, which is the best of my three tools (stopwatch, tape\nmeasure, scale).\nBy tracking the difference in time between workout attempts, we are looking at\nchanges in power. We did not have to study this much longer to come to this un-\nderstanding that your collection of workout data points represented your work\ncapacity across broad time and modal domains.

First, understand that our defini-\ntions of these quantities are measurable. One of the problems with exercise sci-\nence is that it would very rarely meet the rigors of any real science (chemistry,\nphysics, engineering).\nSecondly, it is also almost never about exercise. For example, maximal oxygen\nconsumption (VO2 max) and lactate threshold are correlates, maybe components,\nbut absolutely subordinate to what happens to work capacity. Who would take an\nincrease in VO2max for a decrease in work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains? What that would look like is breathing more air than you ever had before\non a treadmill test in a lab but losing the road race. Similarly, someone\u2019s lactate\nthreshold could increase, but he or she still gets choked out in the fight because of\nlack of work capacity.\nI could make a list of hundreds of these metrics, and no one has ever produced\na great athlete by advancing them one at a time. It does not happen. I can move\nthem best by doing constantly varied, high-intensity functional movements; doing\nthings that look like Fran, Diane, Helen; turning fitness into sport by working with\nfixed workloads and trying to minimize the time by making every workout a com-\npetitive effort among the cohort.

{"42": "TECHNIQUE\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s Dec. 1, 2007, L1 lecture in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nIn no small part, what is behind this program is the quantification of fitness. This\nmeans we put a number on fitness: work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains. You can assess one\u2019s fitness by determining the area under his or her\nwork-capacity curve. This would be similar to a group of athletes competing in 25\nto 30 workouts. Include a range of activities\u2014like three pulls on the Concept2 row-\ner for average watts to a 10-mile run\u2014and a multitude of workouts in between.\nCompile their overall placing across these events, and everyone then has a reason-\nable metric of his or her total capacity.\nThis quantification of fitness is a part of a broader concept that is at the heart of\nthis movement: We call it evidence-based fitness. This means measurable, observ-\nable, repeatable data is used in analyzing and assessing a fitness program. There\nare three meaningful components to analysis of a fitness program: safety, efficacy,\nand efficiency.\nThe efficacy of a program means, \u201cWhat is the return?\u201d Maybe a fitness program\nadvertises that it will make you a better soccer player. There needs to be evidence\nof this supported by measurable, observable, repeatable data. For CrossFit, we\nwant to increase your work capacity across broad time and modal domains. This is\nthe efficacy of this program. What are the tangible results? What is the adaptation\nthat the program induces?\nEfficiency is the time rate of that adaptation. Maybe the fitness program adver-\ntises that it can deliver 50 pull-ups. There is a big difference whether it takes six\nmonths versus nine years to achieve that.\nSafety is how many people end up at the finish line. Suppose I have a fitness pro-\ngram.

For example, if\nyou want to do a full twisting dismount on the rings, the technique would be: pull,\nlet go, look, arm up, turn, shoulder drop, etc. Technique includes head posture and\nbody posture. And there are effective and less effective techniques. Technique\nincludes the mechanics, but it is in the macro sense of \u201chow do you complete the\nmovement without the physics?\u201d\nForm is the normative value: This is good or this is bad\u2014\u201cyou should\u201d or \u201cyou\nshouldn\u2019t\u201d applied to mechanics and technique.\nStyle is essentially the signature to a movement; that is, that aspect of the move-\nment that is fairly unique to you.

It is the signature. To be truly just\nthe signature, style elements have no bearing on form, technique or mechanics.\nStyle does not enter into the normative assessment, is not important to technique,\nand does not alter substantially the physics.\nThese four terms are all qualifications to movement.

Being able to shoot accurately and quickly is better than quickly or accurately.\nYou may try to get a job as a typist because you do not make any mistakes.

Work at that 10,000 to 12,000\nfoot-pounds per minute mark to fix the form, and soon enough you will have great\ntechnique at 12,000 foot-pounds per minute. The next step is to achieve that tech-\nnique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute.\nAt first, the technique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute will suffer. Then you must\nnarrow it in.

How much carbohydrate is that? In the qualitative\nsense, your insulin level is \u201ctoo high\u201d if it is driving up your blood pressure, mak-\ning you fat or reducing your ability to suppress blood sugar after eating carbo-\nhydrate.

We can make\nthe Zone more complicated or simpler, but not more effective.\nWe encourage everyone to weigh and measure portions for a couple weeks\nbecause it is supremely worth the effort, not because it is fun. If you choose to\n\u201cguesstimate\u201d portions, you will have the result of CrossFit\u2019s top performers only\nif and when you are lucky.\nWithin a couple of weeks of weighing and measuring, you will have developed an\nuncanny ability to estimate the mass of common food portions, but, more impor-\ntantly, you will have formed a keen visual sense of your nutritional needs. This is a\nprofound awareness.\nIn the Zone scheme, all of humanity calculates to either 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-block meals\nat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with either 1- or 2-block snacks between lunch and\ndinner and again between dinner and bedtime. We have simplified the process for\ndetermining which of the four meal sizes and two snack sizes best suits your needs\n(Table 1).

{"67": "TYPICAL CROSSFIT BLOCK PRESCRIPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS\nTo best understand the Zone Diet, CrossFit athletes should read Dr. Barry Sears\u2019\nbook \u201cEnter the Zone.\u201d This article gives more information regarding block pre-\nscriptions and fat adjustments for CrossFit athletes.\nThe chart based on sex and body type in the article \u201cZone Meal Plans\u201d is perfect\nfor those who want to start the Zone Diet. If the athlete chooses the wrong block\nsize and does not obtain the desired results, the plan can be modified after a few\nweeks. Errors in block selection might slow progress, but initial errors are offset by\nthe huge value in starting a practice of weighing and measuring intake.\nSears details a more precise method to calculate one\u2019s block prescription in \u201cEnter\nthe Zone.\u201d It is:\nZone block prescription = lean body mass (lb.) x activity level (g/lb. of lean\nbody mass) / 7 (g protein/block)\nThe activity level ranges on a scale of 0-1. For those who work out several days a\nweek and do not have a labor-intensive job, the activity level should be 0.7 (most\nCrossFit athletes). By dividing 0.7 by 7 g in the equation, this simplifies to a Zone\nblock prescription that is 10 percent of his or her lean mass.\nThe activity factor should increase if the athlete does CrossFit two or more times a\nday, trains for another sport in addition to CrossFit, or holds a strenuous daily job\n(e.g., construction, farming, etc., and potentially coaching, if on one\u2019s feet all day).\nAlthough CrossFit workouts are relatively intense, they are not long in duration.\nAn individual does not need to increase the activity level value based on intensity\nalone; activity volume determines activity factor.\nSAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE ZONE BLOCK PRESCRIPTION\nSuppose an athlete is 185 lb. (84 kg) with 16 percent body fat. He does CrossFit five\ndays per week and works in a typical office environment. A sample calculation of"}
{"68": "TABLE 1. MACRONUTRIENT AND CALORIE COMPOSITION\nFOR 15 BLOCKS A DAY\nProtein 15 blocks x 7 g = 105 g (420 calories)\nCarbohydrate 15 blocks x 9 g = 135 g (540 calories)\nFat 15 blocks x 3 g = 45 g (405 calories)\nTotal Calories = 1,365\nNote the total calories presented here are underestimated due to hidden calories.\nMost foods are classified by a single macronutrient, despite the presence of some\nother macronutrients (e.g., nuts are classified as a fat but have some protein and\ncarbohydrate calories). These less predominant macronutrients for each source\nare not included in the total calorie calculations.\nThis athlete could also choose to round up to 16 blocks, particularly if he or she is\nmore likely to have compliance issues. The Zone prescription is a calorie-restrictive\ndiet and can be especially difficult for new adopters. When one\u2019s calculation has a\ndecimal value, rounding up to the next whole block might result in slower progress\nbut produce better long-term compliance. Once the athlete has become accus-\ntomed to the diet, then the total blocks can be rounded down to 15, particularly if\ndesired body composition has not been achieved.\nINCREASING FAT INTAKE\nThe caloric restriction leans out the athlete while providing enough protein and\ncarbohydrate for typical CrossFit activity levels. However, the athlete can become\ntoo lean. The athlete is considered \u201ctoo lean\u201d when performance decreases in\ncombination with continued weight loss. \u201cToo lean\u201d should not be based on body\nweight or appearance alone. When a loss of mass coincides with a drop in perfor-\nmance, the athlete needs to add calories to the diet. This can be accomplished by\ndoubling the fat intake (Table 2)."}
{"69": "At twice the fat, the macronutrient ratio based on calories has changed from 30\npercent protein, 40 percent carbohydrate, 30 percent fat to 23 percent protein,\n31 percent carbohydrate, 46 percent fat. Fat can continue to be multiplied if the\nathlete experiences further mass loss and performance decline. Some CrossFit\nathletes have a diet including five times the fat (Table 3).\nTABLE 3.

{"70": "SUPPLEMENTATION\nWhole, unprocessed foods are the best source of both macronutrients and micro-\nnutrients in terms of composition, variety, and density, such that supplementation\nis generally not recommended. We contend that eating a diet composed of known\nquantities and of high-quality whole foods is the most important aspect of nutri-\ntion for improved performance and health. Not only are supplements generally\npoorer nutrient sources, but they are also an unnecessary focus for someone not\nfollowing our basic diet plan of weighed and measured meat and vegetables, etc.\nHowever, we find one supplement beneficial enough to make a blanket recom-\nmendation: fish oil. Fish oil provides omega-3 fatty acids, which are a type of poly-\nunsaturated fat.\nPhysiological fats are known as triglycerides in biological terms; they are composed\nof a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached (Figure 1). The attached fatty\nacids are mixtures of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats. Al-\nthough one fatty acid is prominent in each food, all three are represented to some\ndegree. Figure 2 provides a summary of the types of fat and example food sources.\nThe two types of polyunsaturated fats found most frequently in foods are ome-\nga-3 and omega-6 fats. Classifying a fatty acid as omega-3 versus omega-6 is\ndependent on chemical structure. Polyunsaturated fats are sources of the two\nessential fatty acids, meaning they must be obtained from the diet. They are al-\npha-linolenic acid (ALA) (an omega-3) and linoleic acid (LA) (an omega-6). Ome-\nga-3 fats are known as \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d fats, and omega-6 fats are known as\n\u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d fats based on their physiological functions. Both are needed\nin relatively equal quantities."}

Fish oil provides two types\nof omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid\n(DHA), the form of omega-3 fats preferred by the brain and body. The body can\nconvert ALA to EPA and DHA, but the conversion process is inefficient. Some prac-\ntitioners have recommended a combined daily intake on the order of 3 grams of\nEPA and DHA for an otherwise healthy individual, although the exact amount is\ndictated by one\u2019s total omega-6 intake. Each brand of fish oil has a different con-\ncentration of EPA and DHA per serving as indicated on the label. Individuals might\nhave to take multiple servings to get 3 grams of EPA and DHA, as brands might\ninclude omega-3s that are neither EPA nor DHA (e.g., ALA). Flax seed or oil is not an\nappropriate supplement for omega-3s. Flax is a good source of ALA, but because\nof the poor conversion to EPA and DHA, it is not recommended. If the individual is\nvegan, DHA can be obtained with algae oil.\nResearch has indicated positive health benefits by supplementing with fish oil.\nOmega-3 fats help increase the fluidity of cell membranes, and research has in-\ndicated supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular function,\nnervous-system function, immune health, memory, and mood issues.

There are other factors that\nwill ultimately overshadow any disadvantages inherent in the potentially less ef-\nfective regimen, such as convenience, attitude, exercise selection, and pacing.\nFor the remainder of this article the three-day cycle is the one in discussion, but\nmost of the analysis and discussion applies perfectly to the five-day cycle.\nELEMENTS BY MODALITY\nLooking at the Template Macro View (Table 1) it can readily be seen that the tem-\nplate is based on the rotation of three distinct modalities: monostructural meta-\nbolic conditioning (M), gymnastics (G), and weightlifting (W). The monostructural\nmetabolic conditioning activities are commonly referred to as \u201ccardio,\u201d the pur-\npose of which is primarily to improve cardiorespiratory capacity and stamina.\nThey are repetitive, cyclical movements that could be sustained for long periods\nof time. The gymnastics modality comprises body-weight exercises/elements or\ncalisthenics, and its primary purpose is to improve body control by improving\nneurological components such as coordination, balance, agility, and accuracy, and\nto improve functional upper-body capacity and trunk strength. The weightlifting\nmodality comprises the most important weight-training basics, Olympic lifts and\npowerlifting, where the aim is primarily to increase strength, power, and hip/leg\ncapacity. This category includes any exercise with the addition of an external load.\nTable 2 gives the common exercises used by our program, separated by modality,\nin fleshing out the routines.\nFor metabolic conditioning the exercises are run, bike, row, and jump rope. The\ngymnastics modality includes air squats, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, handstand\npush-ups, rope climbs, muscle-ups, presses to handstands, back/hip extensions,\nsit-ups, and jumps (vertical, box, broad, etc.). The weightlifting modality includes\nTABLE 2. EXERCISES BY MODALITY"}
{"76": "deadlifts, cleans, presses, snatches, clean and jerks, medicine-ball drills and\nthrows, and kettlebell swings.\nThe elements, or exercises, chosen for each modality were selected for their\nfunctionality, neuroendocrine response, and overall capacity to dramatically and\nbroadly impact the human body.\nWORKOUT STRUCTURE\nThe workout structure varies by the inclusion of one, two, or three modalities for\neach day (Table 3). Days 1, 5, and 9 are each single-modality workouts whereas days\n2, 6, and 10 include two modalities each (couplets), and finally, days 3, 7, and 11 use\nthree modalities each (triplets). In every case each modality is represented by a\nsingle exercise or element; i.e., each M, W, and G represents a single exercise from\nmetabolic conditioning, weightlifting, and gymnastics modalities respectively.\nWhen the workout includes a single exercise (days 1, 5, and 9) the focus is on a\nsingle exercise or effort. When the element is the single \u201cM\u201d (day 1) the workout is\na single effort and is typically a long, slow, distance effort. When the modality is a\nsingle \u201cG\u201d (day 5) the workout is practice of a single skill, and typically this skill is\nsufficiently complex to require great practice but might not be yet suitable for in-\nclusion in a timed workout because performance is not yet adequate for efficient\ninclusion. When the modality is the single \u201cW\u201d (day 9) the workout is a single lift and\ntypically performed at high weight and low repetition. It is worth repeating that the\nfocus on days 1, 5, and 9 is single efforts of \u201ccardio\u201d at long distance; improving\nhigh-skill, more complex gymnastics movements; and single/low-rep heavy\nweightlifting basics, respectively. This is not the day to work sprints, pull-ups, or\nhigh-repetition clean and jerks \u2014the other days would be more appropriate.\nTABLE 3.

{"79": "SCALING CROSSFIT\nCrossFit workouts, and especially those on CrossFit.com, are designed to chal-\nlenge even the most advanced athlete. Many athletes need to \u201cscale\u201d (i.e., modify)\nthe workouts for the safest implementation of the program. Finding a CrossFit\naffiliate is one way to receive proper coaching and guidance through this pro-\ncess. In absence of an experienced trainer, this article presents some basic\nconcepts for scaling workouts particularly for beginners. Scaling for other pop-\nulations (e.g., advanced or injured athletes) is discussed in greater detail at the\nLevel 2 Certificate Course, as well as in the Online Scaling Course.\nAthletes will need to scale workouts for variable lengths of time. One\u2019s athletic\nbackground, as well as his or her current health and fitness capacity, dictates how\nlong scaling is necessary. The methodology presented here can be used indefi-\nnitely, but a month is the minimum period for which significant scaling should be\napplied. This introductory period serves two purposes: 1) it develops competency\nof movements used in CrossFit; and 2) it appropriately exposes the athlete to grad-\nual increases in intensity and volume.\nMECHANICS AND CONSISTENCY FIRST\nCrossFit\u2019s charter for creating the most optimal balance of safety, efficacy, and\nefficiency is: mechanics, consistency, then\u2014and only then\u2014intensity. The initial\nexposure to CrossFit is when movement mechanics should be prioritized over in-\ntensity. And for some, just practicing the movements will be intense. It is impera-\ntive that the movements can be performed correctly and consistently before load\nand speed are added. While intensity is an important part of the CrossFit program,\nit is added after movement proficiency is established. Ignoring this order increas-\nes the risk for injury and potentially blunts long-term progress, especially if poor\nmechanics are combined with load.\nSCALING EFFECTIVELY: PRESERVE THE STIMULUS\nWhen scaling workouts, the main principle to follow is \u201cpreserve the stimulus.\u201d"}
{"80": "Intensity and Volume\nTwo factors need to be scaled for every beginner: 1) intensity; and 2) volume. A\nprudent method for beginners is reducing intensity and/or volume by half for at\nleast two weeks. Depending on how the athlete progresses, volume and intensity\ncan be gradually increased in the following weeks, months, and years.\nIntensity refers to the amount of power an athlete generates. Intensity may be\nmodified in three ways: 1) load; 2) speed; and/or 3) volume.\nLoad is the variable to scale first; scaling the load is an easy way to preserve the\nstimulus relative to an athlete\u2019s capacity. Load is also the most common variable\nmodified after the beginner period. Especially for a conditioning workout, the ath-\nlete should use a load that ensures he or she is able to complete the first set or\nround without compromising form or reaching muscular failure. Determining ap-\npropriate loads for newer athletes requires some estimation, and scaling will not\nalways be perfect. Often, loads for newer athletes will be less than 50 percent\nof the prescribed load, especially if an athlete is new to lifting weights. Coaches\nshould err on the side of scaling too much rather than not enough, particularly for\nnewer athletes.\nSpeed tends to be more self-modulated due to the athlete\u2019s fitness level, although\na coach can modulate speed based on the mechanics demonstrated. A coach\nmight have to slow an athlete down to achieve the correct mechanics. Similarly,\ncoaches might have to encourage an athlete who is moving well to move faster,\nthough this is less common when working with beginners (see \u201cTechnique\u201d article).\nVolume is the total amount of work accomplished by the athlete. Depending on\nthe workout, volume can be lowered by reducing: 1) time; 2) reps/rounds; and/or\n3) distance.\nNewer CrossFit athletes might attempt to struggle through a workout where\nthe volume of repetitions (or load, above) is beyond their current capacity. For\nexample, an advanced CrossFit athlete might complete Fran in 2 minutes. That"}
{"81": "Movements\nWhen a movement cannot be performed at all, it can be substituted. CrossFit\nsuggests modifying this variable last because avoiding a movement prevents an\nindividual from developing proficiency in it. An athlete or trainer should first try re-\nducing the load before substituting the movement. If the workout calls for snatch-\nes at 95 lb., for example, it is generally preferable that the athlete performs the\nsnatches with a PVC pipe instead of substituting 95-lb. overhead squats.\nComplete movement substitutions should be considered when a physical limita-\ntion or injury is present, or when the load cannot be reduced. When selecting a\nsubstitute movement, trainers should try to preserve the original movement\u2019s\nfunction and range of motion as best they can. When determining movement sub-\nstitutions consider:\n1) Whether the movement is primarily driven by the lower body or\nupper body.\n2) The movement function (e.g., push versus pull).\n3) The range of motion used by the movement (specifically of the hips,\nknees, and ankles).\n4) The plane of movement.\nParticularly in the case of injury, a complete movement replacement might be nec-\nessary. Consideration of these variables can help trainers select a movement sub-\nstitution or replacement that is as similar as possible to the prescribed movement.\nA SAMPLE WEEK OF SCALING\nThis section outlines five typical CrossFit workouts. For each Workout of the Day\n(WOD), scaled workouts are presented with modifications to volume, load, and\nmovements. Some of the rationale for the options is also described. These scaled\nworkouts should be considered but three examples of the many options available.\nThey do not take the place of scaled workouts created by an experienced trainer\nwho is relying on intuition and detailed knowledge of a specific athlete."}

Doing so will allow the individual to achieve almost the same volume\nwhile he or she develops new skills and/or is exposed to heavier elements.\nCONCLUSION\nAthletes and their trainers should focus on movement proficiency before adding\nspeed and load.

{"108": "THE AIR SQUAT\nAll our athletes begin their squatting with the \u201cair squat\u201d; that is, without any\nweight other than body weight. As a matter of terminology, when we refer to the\n\u201csquat\u201d we are talking about an unladen, body-weight-only squat. When we wish\nto refer to a weighted squat we will use the term back squat, overhead squat, or\nfront squat, referring to those distinct weighted squats. Training with the front,\nback, and overhead squats before the weightless variant has been mastered re-\ntards athletic potential and compromises safety and efficacy.\nWhen has the squat been mastered? This is a good question. It is fair to say that\nthe squat is mastered when both technique and performance are superior. This\nsuggests that none of the points of performance are deficient and fast multiple\nreps are possible. Our favorite standard for fast multiple reps would be the Ta-\nbata squat (20 seconds on/10 seconds off repeated 8 times) with the weakest of\neight intervals being between 18 and 20 reps. Do not misunderstand \u2014we are\nlooking for 18-20 perfect squats in 20 seconds, rest for 10, and repeat seven\nmore times for a total of eight intervals.\nThe most common faults to look for are surrendering of the lumbar curve at the\nbottom, not breaking the parallel plane with the hips, slouching in the chest and\nshoulders, lifting the heels, and not fully extending the hip at the top (Figure 1).\nDo not even think about weighted squats until none of these faults belong to you.\nA relatively small angle of hip extension, while indicative of a beginner\u2019s or weak\nsquat and caused by weak hips extensors, is not strictly considered a fault as\nlong as the lumbar spine is neutral.\nCAUSES OF A BAD SQUAT\n1) Weak glute/hamstring. The glutes and hams are responsible for powerful\nhip extension, which is the key to the athletic performance universe.\n2) Poor engagement, weak control, and no awareness of glute and\nhamstring. The road to powerful, effective hip extension is a three-to-\nfive-year odyssey for most athletes."}

In athletic pursuits you might be\nprone to injury. Should they converge, you are developing useful strength and\npower that can be successfully applied to athletic movements.\nThe functional application or utility of the overhead squat might not be readily\napparent, but there are many real-world occurrences where objects high enough\nto get under are too heavy or not free enough to be jerked or pressed overhead"}

{"121": "body from which these movements emanate, the core, is often referred to as the\n\u201cpower zone.\u201d The muscle groups comprising the \u201cpower zone\u201d include the hip flex-\nors, hip extensors (glutes and hams), spinal erectors, and quadriceps.\nThese lifts are enormous aids to developing the power zone. Additionally, the ad-\nvanced elements of the progression, the push press and jerk, train for and devel-\nop power and speed. Power and speed are \u201cking\u201d in sport performance. Coupling\nforce with velocity is the very essence of power and speed. Some of our favorite\nand most developmental lifts lack this quality.

{"124": "SUMMARY\nFrom shoulder press to push jerk the movements become increasingly more ath-\nletic, functional, and suited to heavier loads. The progression also increasingly\nrelies on the power zone. In the shoulder press, the power zone is used for stabi-\nlization only. In the push press the power zone provides not only stability but also\nthe primary impetus in both the dip and drive. In the push jerk the power zone is\ncalled on for the dip, drive, second dip, and squat. The role of the hip is increased\nin each exercise.\nWith the push press you will be able to drive overhead as much as 30 percent more\nweight than with the shoulder press. The push jerk will allow you to drive as much\nas 30 percent more overhead than you would with the push press.\nIn effect the hip is increasingly recruited through the progression of lifts to assist\nthe arms and shoulders in raising loads overhead. After mastering the push jerk\nyou will find that it will unconsciously displace the push press as your method of\nchoice when going overhead.\nThe second dip on the push jerk will become lower and lower as you both master\nthe technique and increase the load. At some point in your development, the loads\nwill become so substantial that the upper body cannot contribute but a fraction\nto the movement, at which point the catch becomes very low and an increasing\namount of the lift is accomplished by the overhead squat.\nOn both the push press and jerk, the \u201cdip\u201d is critical to the entire movement. The\nstomach is held very tightly and the resultant turnaround from dip to drive is sud-\nden, explosive, and violent.\nTRY THESE\n1) Start with 95 lb. and push press or push jerk 15 straight repetitions, rest\n30 seconds, and repeat for total of 5 sets of 15 repetitions each. Go up\nin weight only when you can complete all 5 sets with only 30 seconds of\nrest between each and do not pause in any set."}

{"133": "THE GLUTE-HAM DEVELOPER (GHD)\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s March 18, 2007, L1 lecture in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nOur definition of core strength is midline stabilization. In profile, there is a ref-\nerence line that trisects the spine and bisects the pelvis. Midline stabilization is\nthe ability to maintain rigidity, stability, and a lack of deflection about that line\n(Figure 1). This translates to improved efficiency and performance and greater\npower output.\nIt is critical to the deadlift, to the laden squat, to the shoulder press, and to any\nsport. In a swimmer\u2019s stroke\u2014when the left leg kicks and right arm pulls\u2014if the\ntorso deviates to one side, you lose energy. Energy is lost in its deflection, wheth-\ner throwing a punch, riding a bicycle, or squatting. The abdominals, with the hip\nflexors, control one side of the torso, with the hip extensors and erectors involved\non the other side.\nHowever, what we have in modern physical culture is an excessive awareness\nand focus on the anterior and not on the posterior. As a culture of athletes and\nnon-athletes alike, we are unfortunately frontally fixated. Pecs\u2014what about the\nrhomboids? Abs\u2014what about the erectors? Quads\u2014what about the glute-ham-\nstring? And for the best of functional movement\u2014punch, jump, throw, run\u2014the\nimpetus comes out of the posterior.\nWe see communities where there is a very deliberate and concerted effort to min-\nimize hip-flexor involvement in exercise. And yet, by insertion and origin, by me-\nchanical position and advantage, and just kinematically, the hip flexors, have\nseveral times the contraction capacity that is estimated of the abdominals. All of it:\nhip extensors, hip flexors, trunk flexors, and ex-\ntensors are essential to midline stabilization. The\nabdominals are just one part of the story.\nFor core strength (midline stabilization), we are"}

There is no trunk-extension work, no hip-extension\nwork, and hip flexion is deliberately limited. Some of these communities also have\nproblems with chronic back injury, which comes at no surprise. If there is anything\nto \u201cmuscle balance,\u201d it makes sense. In how many communities are they doing an\nequal number of deadlifts and squats to their sit-ups? Most of the military/law-en-\nforcement PT is completely devoid of full-range-of-motion hip extension. Rucking,\nrunning, jumping jacks\u2014all will not do it. The run, pull-up, sit-up, push-up, lath-\ner-rinse-repeat PT has no real good core movement. The crunch does not count.\nWhile a cumbersome and space-taking piece of gear, the GHD has been essential\nto our work. We have four of them in 2,500 square feet, so one every 600 feet.\nWe use the GHD for four exercises to heighten awareness and develop capacity\nat midline stabilization. The punchline to the story is that static contractions that\nstabilize the midsection are the most important and functional (powerful) muscu-\nlar contractions in that region. Static contractions for midline stabilization are the\nbest ab exercises known. No amount of crunches are ever going to get you to the\nsame end point as the L-sit, overhead squat, deadlift, etc.\nWhat we suspect is that if you could sequentially fire the abs with the same force\nin any kind of dynamic pattern, you would have the ability to seriously injure your\nspine. If you could ever crunch with the same force that you can stabilize, you\nwould be able to break your back at will. We have come hardwired unable to do\nthat\u2014that is my guess.\nThe movements are presented in the order in which they should be developed in\na client.

Then the back extends sequentially along the spine from \u201csouth\nto north\u201d (Figure 5).\nThis movement does a lot for a coach. It heightens a neurological awareness. It\nallows me to introduce some essential vernacular to the client. If we do not have\ncues that allow me to talk about hip flexion, trunk flexion, hip extension, trunk ex-\ntension, I am fairly worthless with a client. Very early, get clients to know terms. Be\nable to call it out and get the response you need.\nThis movement demonstrates tremendous control. There is hip flexion, hip ex-\ntension, trunk flexion and trunk extension in a combo \u201csnake\u201d move. Using those\nmuscles is essential for midline stabilization and working the posterior.\nThe fourth movement on the GHD is a sit-up but involves no trunk flexion. For the\nGHD sit-up, the pad is set so that the pelvis is free, and the athlete descends back\nto touch the ground and then comes back to seated. More than a few exercise\nphysiologists and certified trainers have observed that this movement is pure hip\nflexion and consequently asserted \u201cthere\u2019s no abs in that.\u201d\nBut what the abs are doing in this exercise is midline stabilization.\nBefore having clients perform the GHD sit-up, ensure they have demonstrated ca-\npacity in the hip extension, back extension, and hip-and-back extension. Even still,\ntheir first GHD sit-ups should be performed in a shortened range of motion, with\nthe trainer spotting behind them (Figure 6). That might be it for the first dose. Once\nthey come back and you can determine the effect from that dose, increase the\nrange of motion and volume as their capacity allows.\nTo perform a GHD sit-up, there is some leg flexion in the descent. Then, the leg\nextends dramatically and pulls the athlete to seated (Figure 7). Conversely, if the\nathlete does not extend the leg to come to seated, the primary movers are the hip"}
{"142": "The force with which an athlete comes up is amazing. Rather than being pulled\nfrom the psoas alone, which is a fairly dysfunctional kind of pull, the athlete uses\nthe full complement of hip-flexor musculature. Any time you are using a fraction of\nthe primary movers responsible for that articulation, it is not natural, not function-\nal, and contrary to nature. Not extending the leg can also be a little irritating to the\nlow back due to this shearing force on the lumbar spine. Performed correctly, the\nmovement is not irritating to the low back. Straightening that leg enables profound\nmusculature to lift from the pelvis.\nThere are people who have this irritation in the spine from a shear force. If you can\nteach them to extend the legs to work the full complement of hip flexors, we will\nmove the margins where this irritation occurs from 3 reps to 4 reps to 10 reps and\nso on. That is rehabilitation. That is neuromuscular re-education.\nThere is an adjunct movement to GHD sit-up in which the athlete is dynamic in the\ntrunk and static in the hip. It is the AbMat sit-up, where we deliberately take the\nhip flexors out of the equation and work the torso dynamically. The hip flexors are\nworking statically or possibly to no significant degree.\nTo do this, the hip flexors need to be removed from the line of action. The fat part\nof the AbMat goes toward the glutes, and the athlete puts the bottom of his or her\nsoles together with the knees butterflied. This positioning makes the hip flexors\ntangential to the line of action; i.e., they cannot do any productive work. This is\ndone deliberately. Then the athlete slowly and under control comes to seated by\ncontracting the abdominals. This is a very dynamic bit of trunk flexion and the hip\nflexors are removed (Figure 8).\nAs the athlete fails, adduct and extend the legs to some degree. This creates more\npurchase for the hip flexors and brings them into the line of action. This allows the\nathlete to modulate the assistance and keep each rep focused on the midsection.\nIf reps are performed slowly and deliberately, most athletes will fail a sit-up with-\nout an AbMat. The failure is not necessarily a neuromuscular failure. It is not"}

But that lum-\nbar region is fairly inflexible, and all that range of motion that is available moves\none from spinally extended through to neutral. There is no more shortening or\nflexion to it; it is not enough to sit up.\nWithout the AbMat, the sit-up is a biphasic movement. While I have solid contact,\nI use upper rectus and create enough momentum to throw the load to the hip\nflexors, where I have more connection. This means that the full rectus has little\nstimulus\u2014it is pulling me from spinally extended through to neutral, but absent\nof any load. The upper rectus is worked where there is a fulcrum, so the back flat-\ntens, but it is the hip flexors that pull me to seated. There is no amount of sit-ups\nyou can do on the ground that is ever going to work you from pubic bone to about\n3 or 4 inches above the belly button. The AbMat moves the athlete from spinally\nextended through to neutral in the lumbar spine against a load.\nHow big would your bench press get if you only pushed air? You would get as\nstrong as your abs will with a ground-based sit-up. With or without the pad, there\nis the same contraction and range of motion in the midsection. Without the pad,\nthe fibers shortened but there was no load and no real work completed. With the\npad, they got the same motion but under a load, and it produced fruitful work.\nThe two sit-ups, GHD and AbMat, complement each other beautifully. One is dy-\nnamic in the hips and static in the trunk; the other is dynamic in the trunk and stat-\nic in the hip. In conjunction with the L-sit (static in the trunk and hip), they develop\na formidable capacity in the midline."}

To communicate knowledge to oth-\ners, a coach must understand what defines proper mechanics and what causes\nbad or inefficient movement. This requires continual study, and one\u2019s teaching will\nimprove with greater understanding in all fields that intersect with fitness.\nAn effective teacher also has a unique ability to relate to every student, regardless\nof his or her background and ability. This requires the teacher to distill a large body\nof knowledge to a single point or a few salient points specific to the current need\nof the athlete and the movement being taught. An effective teacher also takes\nownership for recognizing when communication between the teacher and athlete\nbreaks down. Generally, the more forms of communication a teacher employs\n(verbal, visual, tactile, use of different examples/ analogies, etc.), the more likely\nthe athlete will find success in training.\n2. Seeing\u2014The ability to discern good from poor movement mechanics\nand to identify both gross and subtle faults whether the athlete is in\nmotion or static.\nAn effective trainer demonstrates the ability to see movement and determine\nwhether the mechanics are sound or unsound. This ability first requires knowl-\nedge of when to observe and evaluate very specific aspects of the athlete\u2019s move-\nment (e.g., trunk-to-femur relationship for hip extension, center of pressure on\nfeet for posterior-chain engagement). It also requires knowledge of the differences\nbetween good and poor positions. An effective trainer can see faults both when\nthe athlete is moving (e.g., hip extension) and not moving (e.g., the receiving posi-\ntion of a clean). Newer coaches tend to have the greatest difficulty spotting move-\nment faults while athletes are moving.\n3. Correcting\u2014The ability to facilitate better mechanics for an athlete"}

A trainer needs multiple strategies for each fault because\ndifferent clients often respond to the same cue in a different manner.\nWhen multiple faults occur at once, a trainer is best served by attacking them one\nat a time in order of importance (i.e., triaging). The ordering is based on the se-\nverity of the deviation from ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task; no\nsingle ordering of faults can be used across all athletes and movements. Through-\nout the cueing process, a trainer needs to celebrate small changes or even just\ncelebrate hard work to build rapport and acknowledge a client\u2019s effort even when\nthose efforts are not immediately successful.\nNewer trainers tend to be lacking in their ability to see and correct movement.\nWhen coaching others, trainers need to focus on movement. Good coaches re-\nlentlessly watch movement with a critical eye. Good coaches are constantly ask-\ning the following questions: How could an individual be more efficient and safe?\nWhat cues would result in a better position? How can cues be delivered to produce\nthe best response from the athlete? Good coaches produce noticeable changes in\ntheir athletes\u2019 movement. To develop this critical eye, coaches can work with great\ntrainers, film themselves or other athletes, or film classes.\n4.

{"148": "HOW TO DEVELOP AS A TRAINER\nTo keep up with athletes\u2019 progress, a coach must continue to refine and develop\nhis or her knowledge. If a trainer\u2019s clients are not testing the limits of his or her\nknowledge, the trainer is not doing a good enough job with them. An expert coach\nis eager and proud to have a student exceed his or her abilities but seeks to delay\nit by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the athlete\u2019s\ngrowth. Coaches should focus on development in both academic and practical\nenvironments.\nHere are some suggestions for how trainers can develop:\n1) First and foremost, teach to learn. It is only through experience that\na trainer will learn and gain competency. It is imperative to work with\npeople in a dynamic environment, even if they are friends or family\nin the beginning. Understanding biochemistry, anatomy and teaching\nmethodologies is important and supportive of this endeavor, but it is not\nenough to allow a trainer to apply knowledge in real time.\n2) Watch more experienced coaches\u2014regardless of their specific discipline.\nWatch what they watch and when they watch for it. Listen to their cues.\nThe best coaches often need very few words to produce noticeable\nimprovement in mechanics. Also watch their rapport with clients. What\ndraws clients to them?\n3) Film yourself coaching others. This can also help with your ability to see\nand correct movement faults as you have the luxury of slowing down the\nfootage. Be critical of yourself and use the six criteria detailed above to\nassess strengths and areas for improvement.\n4) Attend a Level 2 Certificate Course (L2). The L2 allows trainers to work\non their coaching (specifically seeing and correcting movement) in the\npresence of their peers. Where the Level 1 Course is important for\nunderstanding the conceptual framework of CrossFit, the goal of the"}

Un-\nder its Certification branch, CrossFit offers courses on topics such as anat-\nomy and physiology and best business practices. Those pursing advanced\ncredentials in CrossFit may use these courses for required continuing-edu-\ncation credits, but the courses are open to anyone.\n6) Read and study everything related to training, movement and health.\n7) Study and follow CrossFit.com. The archives (since 2001) contain years\nof original CrossFit programming. It is a great resource for learning\nand experimenting with workouts. We challenge all trainers to follow\nCrossFit.com programming for at least six months to understand well-\nvaried and challenging CrossFit programming. It provides a good model\nfor the type of workouts, the variance and the volume (i.e., one workout\na day) required for long-term results. It will also provide experience\non how to scale appropriately, as only the most advanced athletes can\ncomplete all CrossFit.com workouts as prescribed (Rx\u2019d).\n8) Pursue higher credentials, such as CrossFit Level 2 Trainer, Certified\nCrossFit Trainer (Level 3) and Certified CrossFit Coach (Level 4). More\ninformation about the Level 2 credential can be found on CrossFit.com/\ncertificate-courses, and more information about the certifications can\nbe found on CrossFit.com/certifications. The CrossFit Level 4 Coach\ncredential is the preeminent trainer designation offered by CrossFit. This\nevaluation provides distinction for expert coaches within the community.\nHOW TO TRAIN OTHERS WHILE GAINING EXPERTISE\nExpert training comes from years of experience and study long after the comple-\ntion of the Level 1 Certificate Course. However, a novice or less experienced person\ncan still train others. Three important principles should guide trainers at all levels:\n\u2022 Master the fundamentals.\n\u2022 Limit the scope.\n\u2022 Pursue excellence."}

These guidelines enable\ntrainers to learn and gain experience while safeguarding the health and well-being\nof people in their care.\nApplying intensity at either end of the spectrum\u2013too much too soon or too little/\nnone at all\u2013blunts the overall benefit from the program. Pushing one\u2019s limits drives\nnew adaptation, and this cannot happen without intensity. On the other hand,\npushing too hard too soon can result in long-term inefficiencies or injury. When\nthe trainer is in doubt, it is better to err on the side of caution and progress slow-\nly. Even at low intensity, many participants see benefits simply from performing\nvaried functional movements, and it will become clear over time when intensity\ncan be added.\nLimit the Scope\nMany CrossFit affiliates follow a group-class model, which can be difficult for a\nnovice coach. The demands of teaching and class management often take the\nattention away from seeing and correcting movement. New trainers are encour-\naged to coach friends and family in individual or small group sessions (two or\nthree athletes) to perfect their ability to improve mechanics before taking on large\ngroup classes. Another option is to assist a head coach for classes and small-group\ntraining. The new trainer can improve his or her ability to discern poor move-\nment and cue good movement, while the head trainer addresses the other logis-\ntics. New trainers should seek out internships or assistant roles at local affiliates\nto gain this experience.

Rather than devising a business model in the pur-\nsuit of money, devise one that is focused on making the training (and, by exten-\nsion, the clients) better. The most effective business plan comes from achieving\nexcellence and letting the market bring the money to you.\nTo pursue excellence, ask the question, \u201cWhat would make the training or the af-\nfiliate better?\u201d An analysis of pros and cons can muddle every decision, and most\nissues can be decided by a simple question: \u201cWill it improve the quality of the pro-\ngramming or the training experience?\u201d If the answer is \u201cYes!\u201d you are most likely\npursuing excellence.\nCROSSFIT COMMUNITY AND REPRESENTATION\nThe Level 1 Certificate Course is a great way to formalize one\u2019s involvement in\nthe CrossFit community.

Rhabdo-\nmyolysis (often simply referred to as \u201crhabdo\u201d) is a medical condition that might\narise from breakdown of muscle tissue and release of the muscle cells\u2019 contents\ninto the bloodstream. This process can damage the kidneys and can lead to renal\nfailure or death in rare cases. Rhabdo is diagnosed when a patient with an appro-\npriate history has an elevated level of creatine kinase, also known as CK or CPK.\nCPK is easier to measure in the blood than myoglobin and is generally used as a\nmarker for rhabdo, even though it is the myoglobin that does the damage.\nTreatment consists of generous amounts of intravenous (IV) fluids to dilute and\nflush the myoglobin through the kidneys. In the worst cases, patients might need\ndialysis while the kidneys recover. Death, though rare, can result when kidney fail-\nure causes imbalances in the usual electrolytes, which can cause cardiac arrhyth-\nmias. Most patients make a complete recovery after being rehydrated with IV fluids\nover anywhere from several hours to a week or so, depending on the severity.\nThere are a few ways a CrossFit trainer can protect athletes from rhabdomyolysis:\n\u2022 Follow the charter of mechanics, consistency, intensity.\n\u2022 Know the movements that have a higher rate of rhabdomyolysis incidence\n(those that prolong the eccentric contraction), and be mindful of the total"}

At affiliates where there are \u201celements\u201d or \u201con-ramp\u201d classes that last a\ncouple of weeks, athletes should still be heavily scaled beyond this introductory\nperiod to ensure adequate time to acclimate to CrossFit training. If there are no\nseparate classes for beginners, treat the workouts as technique sessions for new-\ner athletes\u2013focus on their mechanics rather than speed or load. There is no set\nprotocol for how quickly to increase intensity, but it is wise to err on the side of\ncaution and work toward long-term fitness. Multiple months at scaled loads and\nvolumes are well within a normal timeframe for even the best athletes, with gradu-\nal increases in intensity implemented after that. Trainers need to frequently check\nin with athletes to determine how the previous dose of exercise affected them.\nAlthough intensity is a significant part of CrossFit, each athlete has his or her entire\nlife to continue to improve fitness and tolerance for intensity.\nThe second way to mitigate the risk of rhabdomyolysis is to know the movements\nassociated with a higher rate of incidence. Beginner athletes should keep \u201cnega-\ntives\u201d (movements which prolong the eccentric phase) to a minimum. Although\nnegatives can be an effective way to increase strength, they should not be used\nin high volumes with beginners. Athletes may increase the volume of negatives\ngradually over time.\nWhile the eccentric phase of movements cannot and should not be avoided, there\nare movements in which people are more likely to prolong the eccentric phase. In\nCrossFit, these tend to be jumping pull-ups and full-range-of-motion glute-ham de-\nveloper (GHD) sit-ups. In the jumping pull-up, the athlete should not prolong the\ndescent but should instead immediately drop to an extended-arm position once\nthe chin has cleared the bar, absorbing the impact with the legs. Similarly, in the\nfull-range-of-motion GHD sit-up, newer athletes should use fewer repetitions and\npotentially a shortened range of motion until capacity is developed. It is also prudent\nfor trainers to scale the number of repetitions and the range of motion for athletes\nwho do not routinely use GHD sit-ups regardless of their CrossFit experience. There\nare no exact rules for total volume, but beginners and new CrossFit athletes (and\neven advanced CrossFit athletes who have not been routinely using the GHD) should"}

Certain medications, in-\ncluding statins (cholesterol-lowering agents), increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis.\nSymptoms of rhabdomyolysis include severe generalized muscle pain, nausea\nand vomiting, abdominal cramping, and, in severe cases, dark-red or cola-colored\nurine. The discoloration of the urine comes from the muscle\u2019s myoglobin, which is\nthe same molecule that gives red meat its color. If these symptoms appear follow-\ning a workout (or at any time with regard to dark-red urine), the athlete should seek\nmedical attention immediately.\nThe athletes at highest risk seem to be those with a reasonable baseline level of\nfitness obtained through some non-CrossFit training, those who are returning to\nCrossFit after a layoff, or even experienced CrossFit athletes who reach volume\nor intensity significantly outside their established \u201cnorm.\u201d These athletes have\nsufficient muscle mass and conditioning to create enough intensity to hurt them-\nselves. Generally, the most deconditioned seem to be at less risk (but not zero). It\nis suspected they do not have enough muscle mass or the capacity to generate\nhigh levels of intensity.

Very real risks exist\nfrom equipment condition, use, and arrangement, as well as from improper spot-\nting of athletes during movements.\nEquipment condition refers both to installation and day-to-day maintenance.

Trainers must repair, replace, and discontinue use of faulty\nequipment immediately.\nArrangement refers to the layout of equipment and athletes during a class or\nworkout. Each athlete needs enough space to perform the movements, with an\nadditional buffer to account for the errant-moving equipment, missed attempts,\nand safe passage of coaches or other athletes. Under no circumstances should a\ntrainer permit extra equipment like bars, plates, boxes, etc. to be left lying around\nthe workout area. This equipment might trip athletes or cause a ricochet if other\nequipment lands on it.\nIt is also imperative for a trainer to prepare for falls during dynamic movements. It is\npossible that an athlete might lose his or her grip during a kip (pull-up or muscle-up).\nTrainers might encourage athletes to wrap their thumbs around any bar in an ef-\nfort to provide additional feedback to the athlete. This is not foolproof, however,\nand can sometimes be even less secure, particularly for athletes with small hands.\nWhatever the hand position chosen, it does not replace the need for the athlete to\ndevelop body awareness of when to end the movement if his or her grip is compro-\nmised (wrapping thumbs is always recommended for barbell and ring movements\nto help provide better balance and control, especially in higher-risk scenarios such\nas a bench press or muscle-up). Boxes and racks should not be beneath, behind or\ndirectly in front of these athletes. Adjustable rings should be lowered to the appro-\npriate height. Where assistance boxes are necessary, they are best placed to the side\nof the working athlete (and not in another athlete\u2019s way) to leave a clear path should\nan athlete leave the apparatus prematurely. A suggestion for trainers trying to man-\nage these risks is to do a \u201cdry run\u201d of the workout before it begins: check the working\nspace for each athlete for each of the proposed movements. This can be as simple as\norganizing the class to rotate stations on the trainer\u2019s call and perform a quick walk-\nthrough to check spacing and arrangement. Trainers can then instruct participants\nto move to the same spot during the workout to ensure safety.\nAthletes also need instruction regarding how to bail safely from lifts and how to\nspot other athletes where appropriate.

A blood-spill clean-\nup procedure can be found in the CrossFit Journal archives.\nMONITORING ATHLETES FOR CONDITIONS THAT NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION\nAlthough a trainer is primarily there to instruct and improve athlete movements,\nhe or she needs to monitor the level of exertion during the workout and ensure\nathlete health is protected. As CrossFit workouts use relatively high intensity, ath-\nletes are working at their physical and psychological tolerances. It is possible for\nathletes to push too hard, and confounding environmental factors might exacer-\nbate certain situations.\nExtreme temperature fluctuations, especially heat, can be problematic. Trainers\nshould be ready in unseasonably hot and humid weather with sufficient water, and\nthey should watch for common signs of overexertion (e.g., dizziness). Hot weather\nalso increases the potential risk for rhabdomyolysis (although some cases have\noccurred in cold climates), and trainers should encourage athletes to stay hydrated\n(with the caveat that they should not be excessively hydrated. Current mainstream\nliterature suggests rates of 1.2 L/hour, which are actually too high and can lead to\noverhydration). In the event of a potential heat stroke following a workout (e.g.,\nathlete demonstrates an altered mental state), a trainer should remove excess\nclothing from the athlete and then douse him or her with cool water before med-\nical attention arrives.\nWeather aside, other conditions might need medical attention. Symptoms such\nas numbness or chronic pain in joints and muscles should be referred to medical\nprofessionals. Medical attention is immediately necessary for any non-respon-\nsive athlete."}
{"158": "We advise against rehydration strategies that encourage consumption of fluids to\nprevent loss of body-weight during activity. Dehydration during physical activity is\na normal physiological process, and the thirst mechanism is sufficient in regulating\nhydration and serum sodium concentration during exercise.\nDrinking beyond thirst in an attempt to prevent body-weight loss during exercise\noffers no benefit to health or performance. It also presents a serious risk of ex-\nercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), a potentially deadly dilution of the body\u2019s\nserum sodium concentration. EAH is caused by overconsumption of fluid and can\nbe viewed as an iatrogenic condition due to the prevailing belief that exercising\nathletes should drink \u201cas much fluid as tolerable\u201d during training.\n\u201cFluid\u201d that can contribute to EAH includes electrolyte-enhanced sports drinks.\nContrary to popular belief, these commercial beverages do not reduce risk of hy-\nponatremia. Because of flavoring and sugar content, these drinks might present\ngreater risk for overconsumption of fluid than water alone, increasing the risk of\npotentially deadly EAH in athletes.\nSPECIAL POPULATIONS\nAny potential athlete with a medical condition needs to be cleared by a physician for\nexercise before a trainer recommends a fitness regimen.

Virtuosity is defined in gymnas-\ntics as \u201cperforming the common uncommonly well.\u201d Unlike risk and originality,\nvirtuosity is elusive, supremely elusive. It is, however, readily recognized by the\naudience as well as coaches and athletes. But more importantly, more to my point,\nvirtuosity is more than the requirement for that last tenth of a point; it is always\nthe mark of true mastery (and of genius and beauty).\nThere is a compelling tendency among novices developing any skill or art, whether\nlearning to play the violin, write poetry, or compete in gymnastics, to quickly move\npast the fundamentals and on to more elaborate, more sophisticated movements,\nskills, or techniques. This compulsion is the novice\u2019s curse\u2013the rush to original-\nity and risk.\nThe novice\u2019s curse is manifested as excessive adornment, silly creativity, weak\nfundamentals and, ultimately, marked lack of virtuosity and delayed mastery.

{"162": "PROFESSIONAL TRAINING\nOriginally published in January 2006.\nI am a fitness trainer. My practice is more\nthan just a job; it is my passion. My clients\nare my top priority and their successes\nare my life\u2019s work\u2013I am a professional.\nOn the surface, my job is to shepherd my\nathletes (I view all my clients as athletes\nregardless of their age or ability) toward\nphysical prowess, but I recognize a pur-\npose to my efforts and an impact on my\nathletes that transcends the physical.\nI view training as a physical metaphor\nfor habits and attitudes that foster suc-\ncess in all arenas. I stress that point to\nall who train with me, and I know I have\nbeen successful only after they bring\nback concrete examples.\nThe lessons learned through physical training are unavoidable. The character\ntraits required and developed through physical training are universally applicable\nto all endeavors. Perseverance, industry, sacrifice, self-control, integrity, honesty,\nand commitment are best and easiest learned in the gym. Even clients who have\nfound spectacular success in business, sport, war, or love find their most import-\nant values buttressed, refined, and nourished in rigorous training.\nBeing a professional, I believe that my competency is solely determined by my\nefficacy.

{"163": "My commitment to my athletes is clearly expressed and perceived in our first\nmeeting. I am all theirs. They are the object of my focus and the focus of my con-\nversation. They come back not because of my physical capacity but because they\nbelieve in my capacity to develop theirs. World-class athletes rarely make world-\nclass trainers.\nI understand that the modern and near-universal trend of skill-less and low-skill\nprogramming delivers inferior results and makes cheerleaders of trainers. I will\nhave none of it. I have to understand the mechanics, cues, and techniques of com-\nplex movements and to be able to teach them to others. I bring a skill set to my\ntraining that scares off most trainers.\nKeeping up with my athletes\u2019 progress demands that I continue to refine and ad-\nvance my understanding of advanced skills. If a trainer\u2019s clients are not testing\nthe limits of his knowledge, he is not doing a good enough job with them. The\nmaster trainer is eager and proud to have a student exceed his abilities but seeks\nto delay it by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the\nathlete\u2019s growth.\nBecause I want my clients\u2019 training experience to transcend the physical realm,\nI am obligated to understand their jobs, hobbies, families, and goals. Motivating\nclients to transcend fitness requires that I be involved in their lives. This is not go-\ning to happen without my being both interested in them and interesting to them.\nBeing a voracious reader of books, newspapers, and magazines, I have no short-\nage of conversation, ideas, and knowledge to share, and so you will find me at my\nclients\u2019 parties, weddings, and family gatherings. Indeed, I am a personal friend to\nnearly every one of my clients. This is extremely gratifying work and often emo-\ntionally charged, but that is all right because I am an integral part of my athletes\u2019\nlives, and life is full of laughter, tears, and hope.\nOur friendship, the fun we have, and the frequency of our contact, coupled with\nthe scope of fitness\u2019s impact and the technical merits of my training, contribute to"}

More than just the\nbackbone of CrossFit\u2019s strength and successes, it has been, we believe, the prima-\nry reason for our success.\nUsing this template, we built a practice that kept us both busy from roughly\n5 to 10 a.m. Monday through Saturday. That schedule produced a low-six-figure in-\ncome, which is really amazing given that we got to work together, with our friends,\nhaving a positive impact on people\u2019s lives, and keep afternoons free for family,\nrecreation, and study.\nTraining with the attention and commitment that we bring to our practice, though\nfun and immensely rewarding, is also draining, and five appointments per day is\nabout all we could handle without an unacceptable drop in energy, focus, and,\nconsequently, professional standards.\nEventually, the demand for our training exceeded the time we were professionally\nable or willing to allot. In an effort to accommodate more athletes, we began to\nhold group classes.\nWe had used group classes to train some of our athletic teams, and everyone\nloved them, trainers and athletes alike.

They also seem to have an inordinate\ndifficulty filling their classes.\nThis is exactly how we built our group classes. After working for years at the limit\nof our one-on-one capacity, we started accepting new clients by doubling them up\nwith other one-on-one clients to form one-on-two appointments.\nWe introduced the shift to group classes by telling the existing one-on-one clients\nthat we had good news for them: \u201cYour training rate is going to go down and we\u2019re\ngoing to introduce you to a new friend.\u201d Where there was resistance to sharing the\ntime we asked for a trial period.

Seeing builds on this knowledge by\nrequiring the trainer to assess these points of performance (and deviation from\nthem) in real time. Correcting is the ability to improve a client\u2019s mechanics to better\nadhere to the points of performance.\nEach movement has at least two sections: 1) Points of Performance; and 2) Com-\nmon Faults and Corrections.

Effectiveness can be assessed by asking whether clients optimize\nwork capacity across broad time and modal domains (i.e., whether a client becomes as fit and healthy as possible)\nA newer trainer may have only rudimentary capacity in each area and clients still will see results because of the\ninherent benefits of performing constantly varied functional movements at high intensity. An effective trainer, on\nthe other hand, has the ability to safeguard health and improve performance for a client beyond what he or she\ncould do alone.\nAlthough these areas can be described and defined independently (below), there is a natural overlap among them in\na real-time coaching environment. A deficiency in any one area can inhibit a trainer\u2019s success. Even a weakness in one\narea relative to the others blunts the trainer\u2019s overall reach. For example, a trainer with tremendous knowledge and\ntechnical skill (teaching, seeing, and correcting) will still have difficulty retaining members if there is little persona\nconnection with them (presence and attitude).\nRegardless of a trainer\u2019s current level of proficiency, a commitment to improving each area is the hallmark of a\nsuccessful trainer. Similar to the athlete\u2019s path to refining and improving movement mechanics, a trainer must refine\ncoaching skills across a career to become great. Doing so develops virtuosity in coaching.\nTEACHING\nThe ability to effectively articulate and instruct the mechanics of each movement, including the ability to focus on major\npoints of performance before more subtle or nuanced ones. It also includes the ability to change instruction based on\nthe athlete\u2019s needs and capacity.\nTo teach functional movements, a trainer must first understand what defines proper mechanics and what may cause\npoor movement. A trainer must know ideal positions, but more frequently a trainer\u2019s job is to teach athletes how to\nimprove poor positions and movement patterns.\nKnowledge in fitness-related areas\nBeyond movement mechanics, trainers can also instruct clients in other areas that may improve their fitness. Greater\nknowledge in any field that overlaps with fitness\u2014such as anatomy and physiology, nutrition, or even expertise in"}
{"262": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\na certain sport\u2014can aid a trainer\u2019s teaching. The more athletically advanced the athlete, the greater the depth of\nknowledge needed for a trainer to produce additional fitness gains. Continued research, education, and practical\nexperience over the course of a career develop a breadth of knowledge applicable to any athlete, from beginner to elite.\nTeaching demands not only possessing knowledge but also the ability to impart it to others. Knowledge alone does\nnot make one an effective teacher. Successful teaching hinges on a trainer\u2019s ability to accurately convey as much of\nthat knowledge as possible to others.\nEffective communication\nTo convey knowledge effectively, a teacher must be able to change his or her communication style to meet the\ncapacity of the student, regardless of his or her background, ability, and learning style. This is why trainers are\nbest served by using different means of communication\u2014visual and verbal teaching, for example\u2014to aid learning.\nImplicit in the trainer-athlete dialogue is the trainer taking responsibility for when communication with the athlete\nbreaks down. It is the trainer\u2019s responsibility to guide and lead the athlete, and it is the athlete\u2019s responsibility to be\ncommitted to the process. However, if the athlete is clearly frustrated with the instruction, the trainer must change\nstrategies or communication style until the athlete succeeds.\nA trainer can also assess the effectiveness of teaching and communication by determining whether the athlete meets\nperformance expectations. If no one in a group moves to the level the trainer expects, he or she needs to reevaluate\nthe instruction. It is often not the athlete\u2019s fault. A good teacher can use effective communication to prevent a large\npercentage of problems from occurring. For example, it is often effective to break complex movements down into\na progression or logical teaching steps that allow the athlete to practice pieces that naturally build on one another.\nA teacher who shows an athlete a barbell clean, describes it in its entirety, and then asks the class to replicate it can\nexpect few (if any) to match the instruction. Conversely, using a progression\u2014such as that demonstrated for the\nmedicine-ball clean at the Level 1 Course\u2014will get more athletes to demonstrate the gross mechanics quickly. These\nprogressions can often help a trainer focus on seeing certain faults as well.\nTeaching as much as is necessary often means the teacher must reduce and simplify his or her body of knowledge\nto the one or two most salient points at that moment for that particular athlete. With fast-paced human movement,\nchange is often hampered by long and detailed explanations when simple, broad-brush instructions are more digest-\nible. This does not mean a trainer\u2019s knowledge of the system should be simple; it is the explanation that should be.\nA trainer can ask himself or herself, \u201cWhat is the one thing this athlete needs right now?\u201d The answer will change as\nprogress is made.\nseeing\nThe ability to distinguish good from poor movement mechanics and identify both gross and subtle faults whether the\nathlete is in motion or static.\nA trainer who can effectively assess the mechanical positions as sound or unsound throughout movement has\ncapacity in seeing. Seeing is the necessary first step for a trainer to bring about change in a client\u2019s mechanics, but it\nrests on one\u2019s teaching capacity (knowledge). Trainers must first know positions of best mechanical leverage, as well\nas the effect of varying anthropometrics on these positions. If a trainer does not know what to look for, he or she will\nnot see correctible issues."}
{"263": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nStatic faults\nThe trainer must also use visual-recognition skills throughout the repetition, whether the athlete is static or dynamic\nStatic positions are the points at which the athlete is not moving, even briefly. Static positions usually occur near\nthe end ranges of motion\u2014either in the starting, receiving, or finishing positions\u2014or when there is a brief pause or\ndecreased speed, often due to a change of direction. Static positions include the setup position for a deadlift or the\nbottom of a squat, for example. Correctly identifying faults is easier in static positions because these positions give\ntrainers more time for assessment.\nDynamic faults\nDynamic positions find the athlete moving between the static positions, often at high speed. Examples of faults\nseen in dynamic movements include not reaching full hip extension in the drive phase of a clean, pressing early in a\npush press, or initiating the squat with the knees. These dynamic faults are more difficult to identify because of the\ndecreased time for assessment. The trainer must also know when and where to see faults during the movement. For\nexample, a trainer needs to see that the athlete has the weight on the heels during the drive phase of a push jerk\nbut the trainer is also evaluating the trunk-to-femur relationship for hip extension, the bar path relative to the fronta\nplane, and a whole host of other relationships. Generally, a profile view of the athlete (offset by about 45 degrees)\nis the most useful view to assess the athlete\u2019s mechanics, but trainers should not be limited to using this view only.\nThe difficulty in seeing dynamic faults increases as:\n1. the athlete moves more quickly, and\n2. the faults become more subtle.\nYears of experience help a trainer effectively coach any level of athlete. New trainers may use a few methods to\ndevelop their ability to see faults, particularly dynamic faults. One method is to study film. Slow the movement down\nto a series of static frames. A trainer may choose to film his or her own athletes or simply watch footage available\non the internet. Replaying the footage in real time after observing the movement in a static series can help bridge\nthe gap between seeing static and dynamic positions. Another strategy for newer trainers is to methodically survey\nathletes for only one fault at a time. For example, when teaching athletes the push jerk, the trainer may choose to\nwatch only for hip extension during the first several repetitions. Then, the trainer may choose to watch and see if\nthe athletes drive through their heels. Over time, trainers can observe multiple faults simultaneously (e.g., lack of hip\nextension or not having the weight on the heels), but initially, trying to see everything often results in seeing nothing\nSimilarly, newer trainers generally find more success by watching one athlete at a time per repetition instead of\nscanning multiple athletes with every repetition.\nCorreCTing\nThe ability to facilitate better mechanics for an athlete using visual, verbal, and/or tactile cues. This includes the ability\nto triage (prioritize) faults in order of importance, which requires an understanding of how multiple faults are related.\nThe ability of a trainer to facilitate improved mechanics is dependent on capacities in teaching and seeing. Teaching\nreflects a trainer\u2019s knowledge of proper mechanics; seeing reflects a trainer\u2019s ability to discern these positions in rea\ntime. If capacity is limited in either, it follows that the trainer\u2019s capacity in correcting will also be weak.\nCorrecting mechanics results in both increased performance gains and decreased risk of injury. A trainer can expect\nto correct an athlete\u2019s mechanics forever; mechanics can be infinitely refined to create ever more efficient positions"}
{"264": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nas the athlete progresses. CrossFit trainers should strive for excellent mechanics in their clients and avoid settling for\n\u201cOK\u201d movement. This means a trainer must be able to correct both gross and subtle deviations in all levels of athletes\nThey must set a high standard for good movement and be relentless in the constant pursuit of improvement.\nCorrecting hinges on the trainer\u2019s ability to:\n1. use successful cues,\n2. know multiple corrections for each fault,\n3. triage faulty movement, and\n4. balance critique with praise.\nCues\nAny cue that results in improved movement mechanics is successful and therefore a good cue. There are no specific\nformulas, formats, or rules to follow for cues, and their value is based on the result. A cue\u2019s primary function is to\nhelp the athlete execute perfect mechanics, not to perfectly describe the mechanics of the movement. For example\none may say \u201cweight in heels\u201d to help a person shift weight back and better achieve pressure across the foot (versus\non the toes). Generally, making cues short, specific, and actionable tends to result in a greater success rate. Short\nspecific, and actionable cues are useful because the trainer gives a single task for the athlete to complete. An example\nof this type of cue is, \u201cPush your knees out.\u201d It is short (four words), specific to a body part (knees), and also indicates\naction and/or direction (out). It is easy for the athlete to respond to a cue such as this, even when performing a com-\nplicated movement.\nIt is possible for a trainer to confuse cueing with fault identification. For example, pointing out the fault that is pres-\nent\u2014\u201cYour knees are caving in\u201d\u2014does not tell the athlete how to fix it. An experienced athlete may be able to make\nthe leap from hearing the identification of the fault to then fixing it, but this translation from fault identification to\nspecific direction is ultimately the trainer\u2019s responsibility.\nTrainers may also rely on more technical language in their cues (i.e., \u201cYou are losing your midline\u201d), which assumes the\nathlete has a significant amount of fitness-related knowledge. While such language may give the appearance of being\nmore technical (and perhaps represents an attempt to sound more intelligent), it is at best a vague verbal cue. Cues\nshould be kept to simple language that is easily understood by anyone. Non-specific language is also best avoided\nin cues. Something such as, \u201cGet tight!\u201d or \u201cChest!\u201d can be meaningless to the athlete, especially in the absence of\ninstruction on how to \u201cget tight\u201d or where and how to move the chest.\nA basic three-step process for developing short, specific, and actionable cues is:\n1. identify the fault,\n2. identify what is out of place (be specific: name the body part), and\n3. give direction to that body part.\nAs stated before, \u201cPush your knees out\u201d is a short, specific, and actionable cue.\nHowever, even with short, specific, and actionable cues, there is no guarantee the athlete\u2019s movement will improve\nThe trainer needs to use multiple cues until the fault is resolved. There are cases in which a cue that is effective for\none athlete is ineffective for another, and in other cases, even a good cue may result in poor movement. \u201cGet your"}

Nevertheless, some athletes interpret this cue to mean that the weight should be on their heels exclusively\nand they fall backwards or lose their balance. That does not mean the cue was bad or the trainer was wrong; it means\nthe trainer has to try an alternative cue.\nA trainer should not be limited to a certain set of cues for a specific fault, and he or she should continue to use differ-\nent cues until the movement improves. Over time, a trainer develops corrective strategies, building a bank of options\nfor every fault. These corrective strategies should include verbal (i.e., speaking), visual (i.e., showing), and tactile\n(i.e., touching) cues, all of which may be employed to fix the same fault but may be interpreted differently among\nathletes. Verbal cues tell the athlete a specific instruction, visual cues create contrasting images between current and\npreferred positioning, and tactile cues use physical targets to achieve proper mechanics. The greater the number of\nstrategies a trainer can employ for any fault, the more likely it is that he or she will be successful in correcting the fault\nTriaging faults\nDetermining which single fault to correct can be a challenge, as multiple faults often occur together. Ideally, every\nfault would be addressed simultaneously, but this is unrealistic in practice. The trainer is best served by triaging\nfaults. The term \u201ctriaging\u201d is most often used in medicine to assign urgency to those needing medical attention\nTriaging when coaching movement means assigning urgency to the multiple faults present in order of the most to\nleast important. Greater importance is assigned to faults that have the highest risk for injury (and, therefore, also the\ngreatest potential to limit performance). In a loaded environment, there are many cases in which the fault to address\nfirst would be loss of a neutral spine, usually in flexion. However, a flexed lumbar curve at depth in an air squat is less\nconcerning than that same position in a loaded back squat. This athlete needs to continue to air squat to full depth\nfighting for a neutral midline, all while maintaining the range of motion required by life. It is precisely the practice of\nthe movement, even with less-than-ideal mechanics, that will eventually allow him or her to reclaim positions that\ncan be loaded. In this example, completing the full range of motion was given more priority than midline stabilization\nThe ordering is based on the severity of the deviation from the ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task\nthere is no single ordering of faults that can be used across all athletes in all applications.\nWhichever fault the trainer decides to fix first should become the trainer\u2019s focus. He or she has to selectively ignore\nthe other faults present. Once that fault is fixed or mitigated at least to the degree that it is no longer the most import-\nant, the trainer can move on to the next issue.\nAfter choosing which fault to address, the trainer needs to know how the various faults are related. A trainer may\ncue a different body part than the one he or she is trying to fix due to the interrelatedness of movement mechanics\nSuppose an athlete performs an air squat with the following faults: weight shifting forward, knees collapsing, and\nback rounding. The trainer needs to consider: Are the caving knees causing the back to round? Is the rounded back\ncausing the weight to shift forward? Perhaps the trainer chooses to address the back position first but actually tells\nthe athlete, \u201cPush the knees out.\u201d There are cases in which allowing more room for the pelvis helps create a neutra\nspine position.\nAssess the cue\u2019s effectiveness and provide feedback\nAfter a trainer delivers a cue, he or she must stay with that athlete for at least another repetition to assess the result\nWhatever the athlete\u2019s response, the trainer needs to provide feedback. A trainer needs to let the athlete know if\nthe movement was the same, better, or worse. If the movement improves, a trainer needs to acknowledge that"}
{"266": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nperhaps with, \u201cThat\u2019s better\u201d or, \u201cGood correction.\u201d This helps the athlete develop kinesthetic awareness of proper\npositioning. In some cases, an athlete may improve movement but not to the desired degree. Encouraging these\nathletes simply to give more in that same direction is often a sound strategy (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s better, but even lower!\u201d). If\nthe movement has not changed, this could be addressed simply by saying, \u201cNot there yet\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019ll come back to you,\u201d\nfor example. An unsuccessful cue should not be repeated multiple times with a single athlete; instead, the trainer\nshould find a new cue. If the movement changes for the worse, the trainer also needs to immediately recognize this\nand stop or reverse it (e.g., \u201cOther way\u201d).\nNot staying to assess the effectiveness of a cue and provide the athlete with feedback is almost the same as not\ngiving a cue at all. If a trainer tells an athlete to do something and walks away before seeing the result, he or she may\nmiss it when a cue results in no change or even change for the worse. The athlete has no idea if his or her efforts\nhave resulted in improvement. All feedback, positive and negative, is tied to the athlete developing better kinesthetic\nawareness. Precision of word choice is critical. The use of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d needs to be reserved for actual sound or\nimproved mechanics and not used as a filler.\nThroughout the cueing process, a trainer must also be aware when praise for hard work (regardless of change) is\nnecessary. There are cases where no change or only a very slight change occurs in a session. Celebrating the effort\nacknowledges the hard work put forth that day and helps a client remain willing to continue to work hard. A trainer\njust needs to be clear when the praise is for the effort rather than a movement that still needs improvement.\ngrouP ManageMenT\nThe ability to organize and manage, both at a micro level (within each class) and at the macro level (the gym as a\nwhole). This includes managing time well; organizing the space, equipment, and participants for optimal flow and\nexperience; planning ahead; etc.\nGroup management is not just about organizing logistical considerations for a class so clients have enough space\ntime, and equipment to complete the workout. It is about optimally managing these variables to support the best\npossible instruction (see \u201cComponents of an Effective Class\u201d). Poor planning of any aspect of a class\u2014for example\nthe amount of time spent on certain parts, how the equipment is set up, and how much time is allotted to each par-\nticipant\u2014can detract from the quality of the experience.\nAdhere to the schedule\nAt its most basic level, effective group management means adhering to posted schedules. Clients plan their sched-\nules around these announced times, and it should not be assumed that they have more time or flexibility. Adhering\nto posted times means both starting and ending on time: Running over is as unacceptable as starting late. Ending\nlate usually occurs when a trainer does not plan ahead and think through the entire class schedule. Adhering to the\nschedule also includes the schedule within each class. Following a simple template (such as introduction, warm-up\nworkout, and post-workout) every class helps ensure necessary time is devoted to each piece (see \u201cComponents of\nan Effective Class\u201d). The trainer may also consider the experience level of the class to determine which pieces need\nmore time or less time during instruction.\nSpace and equipment layout\nGroup management also includes variables such as space layout and equipment availability. The layout needs to\naccount for buffer zones around any equipment in use and should also take into account when athletes have to move"}
{"267": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nto different areas of the gym during the workout. The class size often dictates which workouts are realistic given the\nequipment and space. Even in cases in which neither is limited, an effective trainer should have pre-determined alter-\nnatives for any class workout should a larger number of participants show up unexpectedly.\nGroup management speaks to the trainer\u2019s ability to reduce the logistical setup and preparation time during a class to\nmaximize the amount of teaching and movement time. This means the trainer plans ahead and perhaps prearranges\na complicated workout with multiple pieces of equipment and/or weights. Spending several or more minutes sorting\nequipment takes away from a trainer\u2019s time to instruct, improve, and refine movement.\nPlan how and what to teach\nTime spent on instruction can also reduce the client\u2019s practice time. A trainer needs to plan how and what to teach to\nmaximize the client\u2019s time moving. Allowing for enough practice time every class is necessary for both the trainer and\nclient. Less practice time gives the trainer less time to observe and cue movement mechanics, as well as less time for\na client to work on movement with improved form. Change in mechanics comes from continual cueing across many\nrepetitions.\nDuring every class, the trainer also needs to manage the attention given to each participant. Every student should\nfeel that he or she received enough attention. While some clients need more time than others, even good movers\nwith subtle inefficiencies need to be coached, pushed for higher speed and/or loads, or praised for sound perfor-\nmance. Attention still benefits them. To assist with each client getting enough individual attention, a helpful tool is\nto keep the group on the trainer\u2019s cadence for all repetitions during the warm-up or skill work. Controlling when the\ngroup moves ensures the same number of repetitions are completed by everyone. It also allows the trainer to sys-\ntematically and selectively observe individuals and specific aspects of their movement.\nThe size of the class affects how much time a trainer can spend with each person, but the class size should not be\nbeyond the trainer\u2019s capacity. The demands of large classes often turn trainers into crowd herders, timekeepers and\ncheerleaders who have little time to spend on cueing individual movement faults. Newer trainers (those with less\nthan two years of experience) can rarely find success when stepping into classes of 10-plus participants. In his article\n\u201cScaling Professional Training,\u201d CrossFit Founder Greg Glassman explained that after years of one-on-one persona\ntraining produced groups of two, eventually groups of three, and so on, his classes continued to grow until growth\nresulted in \u201cperceived reduction in attention\u201d to each paying member.\nRegardless of experience, trainers should make an honest assessment of the time and attention given to each client\nafter each training session.

If the answer to either question is no, the session was likely too large for the trainer\nThe goal is to maximize a trainer\u2019s effectiveness and reach.\nPresenCe and aTTiTude\nThe ability to create a positive and engaging learning environment, showing empathy for athletes and creating rapport\n\u201cPresence and attitude\u201d refers to the trainer\u2019s ability to create a positive atmosphere and develop a rapport with each\nclient. Although more subjective than the other five areas of effective training, developing a positive presence and\nattitude is equally if not more important."}
{"268": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nKnow your clients\nAn effective trainer recognizes that each person has different abilities, insecurities, needs, and goals; he or she also\nhas the awareness and interpersonal skills to respond accordingly. The trainer recognizes that individuals respond\ndifferently to instruction and critique and makes it his or her responsibility to determine how best to relate to and\nmotivate each individual regardless of background and ability.\nA trainer must be aware of whether each client is interested in each class; a client\u2019s needs may change with the days\nand external life demands. The trainer should know what is happening with most of the group most of the time, and\nthis goes beyond movement mechanics. This includes issues such as who is struggling that day due to external pres-\nsures or stress, who has high energy, who is aloof or annoyed, who is new to the gym, etc. All these factors may affect\nthe degree to which the athletes can perform relative to their usual capacity. Effective trainers know these things\nbecause they routinely interact with their clients and are invested in their relationships with them.\nA common trait of trainers with a positive presence and attitude is that they genuinely care about their clients\u2019 success\nThis care means more to clients than the trainer\u2019s knowledge. Many clients have little interest in the technical aspects\nof training. Their interests often lie in unrelated professions and hobbies, and they are at the gym to improve the\nquality of their lives. The mechanisms of their success in the gym are much less important to them than the results\nand success itself. In addition to seeing results, clients know if they feel welcomed and cared for, respected, inspired\nand motivated. They can sense whether the trainer has their best interests at heart.\nBe authentic\nA positive presence and attitude cannot be faked; it comes from a sincere passion for service. It can take on many\nforms based on the trainer\u2019s personality and interpersonal skills. Trainers should not interpret this as being any single\ntrait, such as loud, funny, or bubbly. Trainers are encouraged to be authentic. There is room for any personality type\nto succeed if a trainer couples genuine caring with awareness of his or her limitations and recognizes the effect he\nor she may have on clients. This may motivate a trainer to become a better version of himself or herself. A trainer\nmay set personal goals to compensate for any perceived shortcomings. For example, a trainer who is perceived as\nreserved may make an effort to be at class early to welcome and greet each member.\nNewer trainers especially may be shy or nervous in front of a group, and this may blunt their presence and attitude\nSmall mechanical changes, such as eye contact, open body language, and smiling, can go a long way toward putting\nthe trainer\u2019s best foot forward. Trainers might try asking clients simple questions about well-being and then really\nlistening and following up about their answers. These are basic interpersonal skills trainers can initially rely on unti\nthey become more comfortable and engaged with their clients.\ndeMonsTraTion\nThe ability to provide athletes with an accurate visual example of the movement at hand. A trainer may do this using\nhimself or herself as an example or by choosing another athlete to provide the example. This requires a strong aware-\nness of one\u2019s own movement mechanics. It also includes the concept of leading by example; a trainer should follow his\nor her own advice and be an inspiration to clients.\nProvide a visual aid\nDemonstration is a powerful visual tool to aid a trainer\u2019s instruction.

This requires a trainer to adjust demonstrations depend-\ning on the group and its needs. Just like teaching, demonstration may have to be made more simple and obvious\nthan realistic and subtle to meet the needs of the trainees. In cases in which a trainer\u2019s mechanics are limited, using\nothers for demonstration is perfectly acceptable. Trainers who have the capacity to discern good movement patterns\nquickly do not have a problem finding an effective substitute.\nDemonstrate credibility\nDemonstration also covers whether a trainer demonstrates to others that he or she ascribes to the program that is\nrecommended and holds himself or herself to the same standards and values expected of clients. Demonstration\nmore broadly speaks to the trainer\u2019s credibility. Leading by example has a large influence on the culture created at\nthe trainer\u2019s gym. A trainer can ask: How do I get my clients to care about technique? To push themselves harder? To\nadhere to workout standards? To treat each other with respect? Many answers can be provided by examining a train-\ner\u2019s own attitude and actions. The trainer needs to work on improved technique, use high intensity, follow the same\nprogram, follow the range-of-motion standards, count repetitions correctly, support and encourage others, etc.\nThis means a trainer can utilize his or her own firsthand experiences with diet strategies, workout programs, com-\npetition scenarios, etc. to address clients\u2019 questions and help them reach their goals. Insight and advice are best\ndelivered when they are the result of experience.

An effective trainer must\nhave capacity in each area, and a trainer\u2019s effectiveness is limited by capacity in each. A professional trainer contin-\nues to develop capacity in each area across his or her entire career. This is chasing virtuosity in coaching. \u201cDoing the\ncommon uncommonly well\u201d does not only apply to movement; it can apply to any particular skill.

{"272": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nCOMMON MOVEMENT THEMES FOR FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS\ninTroduCTion\nThere are common movement themes displayed in all foundational movements, from the nine foundational move-\nments in the Level 1 Course to others such as the snatch, kipping pull-up, and handstand push-up. These movement\nthemes broadly categorize similar positions and movement patterns, whether the athlete is static (starting, receiving\nor finishing positions) or dynamic (moving between static positions).\nThese themes are:\n\u2022 midline stabilization,\n\u2022 core-to-extremity movement,\n\u2022 balance about the frontal plane,\n\u2022 posterior-chain engagement,\n\u2022 sound hip function,\n\u2022 active shoulders,\n\u2022 full range of motion about a joint, and\n\u2022 effective stance and/or grip.\nUnderstanding these themes and the contexts in which to apply them will give trainers the general principles for eval-\nuating movement. There are positions or movement patterns that do not fit neatly into these categories, as well as\nmovements that do not demonstrate all the themes. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. It is simply a classification\ntool that can be used to aid development of one\u2019s coaching skill set.\nThese themes are exemplified when an athlete performs a movement correctly (i.e., adhering to the points of per-\nformance). The movement themes increase the potential for improved performance and minimize the risk of injury\nSound mechanics aid performance and risk management by using positions with the best mechanical and muscular\nalignment, conferring safety, efficacy, and efficiency simultaneously.\nMidLine sTabiLiZaTion\nA \u201cmidline\u201d is a plane of bilateral symmetry, but it is used in CrossFit to specifically refer to the relationship of the\nspine (base of the head to the top of the hips) and pelvis during functional movement. The midline trisects the spine\nand bisects the pelvis when the two are in their neutral anatomical relationship. Stabilization means something has\nbeen made stable, or \u201cstatic.\u201d Midline stabilization refers to the athlete\u2019s capacity to prevent movement from this\nneutral spinal position and is synonymous with core strength. Midline stabilization determines whether the athlete\ncan maintain the natural S-curve of the spine to the pelvis when dynamic and/or loaded. Some lifting applications\nrely on a midline posture with some extension past neutral in both the lumbar and thoracic regions. Regardless, this\nposture is maintained throughout the movement.\nStabilization of the spine is largely accomplished by engaging the abdominals (\u201cabs\u201d), internal and external oblique\nmuscles (\u201cobliques\u201d), and erector spinae (\u201cspinal erectors\u201d or simply \u201cerectors\u201d). Engaging the abs helps engage the\nspinal erectors and obliques; together, they create a belt of musculature around the vertebrae."}
{"273": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nTorso as a rigid, integrated structure\nThis neutral, static position maximizes performance because moving the torso as one rigid, integrated structure\nenables the transmission of force between the appendages and the object being lifted. In a push jerk, for example\nthe legs and hips extend force upward into the weight through the torso. A soft midline does not allow for the optima\ntransfer of force to the bar.\nWhen maintaining a neutral spine, the orientation of the vertebrae results in favorable distribution of forces and\nreduces the risk for injury. Where possible, it is ideal to have the midline in a vertical orientation because of the optima\nmuscular and skeletal alignment for force distribution (e.g., in a squat). As the torso moves from a vertical orientation\nas in the deadlift, the demand on the musculature to maintain a neutral spine increases. Forward movement of the\ntorso, however, does not increase the risk of injury if midline stabilization is present. It is when midline stabilization\nis lost that the shear force experienced by the spine increases. The human spine is more susceptible to injury when\nexposed to shear (vs. compression) forces. The resulting shear force attempts to push one vertebra past another\nwhile muscles and ligaments resist this loss of positioning. If the muscles and ligaments are not strong enough, an\ninjury to the spine may occur.\nDeviations from neutral\nDeviations from neutral may occur in flexion (bending forward from neutral) or extension (bending backward from\nneutral). Recall that a natural function of the abdominals is to flex the spine, so spinal flexion by itself is not nec-\nessarily problematic (e.g., getting out of bed) and is potentially beneficial to reduce the lever arm (e.g., gymnastics\nholds). Similarly, the erectors extend the spine. Extending past neutral is not inherently dangerous but can become\nso depending on degree of deviation and the load on the body.\nThe following hierarchy of spinal positioning is listed in order of increasing risk for injury:\n\u2022 Safest: Midline stabilization in a neutral position.\n\u2022 More risky: A non-neutral spine in a static position. Although less ideal than midline stabilization in\na neutral position, static positions (flexed or extended) prevent movement of the individual spinal\nsegments. This means no individual vertebra bears the majority of the lifting force.\n\u2022 Most risky: Loss of a neutral spine during movement, specifically when starting from neutral and moving\nto significant spinal flexion. This is potentially the most injurious, as there is movement of the individual\nspinal segments and one or a few vertebra(e) bear the majority of the lifting force.\nThe most common injury from a loss of midline stabilization occurs when the lumbar spine (L1\u2013L5) flexes under\nload, changing the normal concave curvature of the lower back to convex. Typically, flexion of the spine is seen with\nincreased hip flexion or when the midline is resisting a load on the front side of the body, as in a deadlift.\nAthletes may also deviate from neutral by overextending or hyperextending the spine, which means significantly\nbending backward from neutral into an injurious range of motion. There is a difference between the natural S-curva-\nture of the spine and an exaggerated extension of the spine. Placing athletes in an overextended position does not\nincrease the benefits of a neutral spine and may place them at risk for injury.\nHyperextension can result in the same injuries as excessive flexion (i.e., disc herniation or damage to facet joints)\nHyperextension generally occurs with more flexible athletes or occasionally with more advanced athletes. Over-"}
{"274": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nextension or hyperextension often points to a lack of engagement of the abdominals and can generally be addressed\nby cueing an athlete to tighten the abs. It is most often seen when an athlete lifts overhead.\nCORE-TO-EXTREMITY MOVEMENT\nCore-to-extremity movements demonstrate a sequence of muscular contraction that begins with the large force-pro-\nducing, low-velocity muscles of the core (abdominals and spinal erectors) and hips, and ends with the small force-pro-\nducing, high-velocity muscles of the extremities (e.g., biceps, calves, wrist flexors). Core-to-extremity movement\nbegins with establishing midline stabilization for effective force transfer\u2014i.e., a base is created and force radiates\nfrom there. This muscular patterning teaches the athlete to fluidly transmit power from one area of the body to\nanother. Core-to-extremity movement maximizes performance because it tasks the largest musculature to generate\nforce first, allowing the greatest forces to develop. This sequence improves efficiency and allows the greatest amount\nof work to be accomplished.\nCore-to-extremity movements are less risky than movements that violate this pattern because the largest muscles\nare tasked with generating the most force. Smaller muscle groups and associated tendons and ligaments are more\nsusceptible to injury, such as tearing, when exposed to loading designed for larger movers.\nCore-to-extremity movements are found everywhere, not just with movements that involve the arms and legs, so\nfaults can show up everywhere. Even a shoulder press or a deadlift may not effectively demonstrate core-to-extrem-\nity movement absent a stable midline. For dynamic faults, core-to-extremity violations occur when there is incorrect\ntiming and the arms move before the hips and legs have extended (i.e., pulling or pushing early).\nBALANCE ABOUT THE FRONTAL PLANE\nThe frontal plane divides the athlete into anterior and posterior halves. It is the plane about which one is balanced\nand it bisects the athlete at mid-foot. Referencing the athlete\u2019s movement (i.e., his or her line of action) and the object\nhe or she is moving relative to the frontal plane can often determine the athlete\u2019s efficiency.\nSignificant deviations of the athlete and/or object forward of the frontal plane prevent successful task completion\nespecially as the loading increases. These deviations can also impair other points of performance (i.e., neutral spine\nweight on the heels). Generally, moving an object along straight lines (i.e., in the frontal plane) can increase perfor-\nmance by increasing efficiency as the object follows the shortest distance between two points. Note, however, the\nathlete\u2019s movement accommodates the object and may or may not be characterized by straight lines. For example\nin a movement such as the squat, an effective line of action is created when the hips sit back and down as the knees\nbend. In this manner, the athlete is best able to keep the weight on the heels, and when the squat is loaded, the bar\ntravels along the shortest line. This movement also can reduce excessive force at the patella, which may occur if the\nknees translate excessively forward (i.e., such that the heels come up).\nBalance about the frontal plane can also be referenced in a kipping pull-up, where the plane is formed along the\nline from the hands to the floor. The athlete is most efficient when the center of mass oscillates about this plane to\nmaintain the most efficient timing of the swing. In the kipping pull-up, when the center of mass deviates from the\nfrontal plane too much, the athlete loses timing and has to reset the swing.\nA lack of balance about the frontal plane may increase the risk for injury because of increased potential for other\nmovement errors. For example, if the chest drops in a front squat with the bar deviating forward of the fronta"}

However, a violation of balance about the frontal plane by itself is not\nterribly risky.\nPOSTERIOR-CHAIN ENGAGEMENT\nThe posterior chain includes the group of muscles, tendons, and ligaments on the posterior (back) of the body, which\ncontains the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), gluteal muscles (\u201cglutes\u201d), and spina\nerectors. \u201cEngagement\u201d means this musculature contributes to the movement. Posterior-chain engagement does not\nrefer to using the posterior chain in an attempt to exclude the anterior chain. Ideally, there is a balance of pressure\nbetween the balls of the feet and the heels, with the line of action at the frontal plane. Posterior-chain engagement\nalso enables the athlete to maintain optimal knee alignment with the foot.\nInclusion of this large set of musculature on the backside of the body maximizes performance because of the\nincreased power generation, thereby resulting in faster speed to completion or increased load lifted. Keeping the\nheels rooted brings the load closer to the frontal plane, which helps the athlete stay balanced and drive the load up\nnot forward. This increases efficiency. Engagement of the spinal erectors is also essential for maintaining midline\nstabilization and providing the strongest base to transmit forces.\nFinally, engagement of the posterior chain helps keep the knees in line with the toes, where there is the best mechan-\nical position of leverage between the upper and lower leg. With posterior-chain engagement, greater musculature is\nrecruited to move the load, and enough room is created for full range of motion in a squatting movement. When the\nknees collapse inward, the center of pressure shifts forward (given the angle at which the knees flex). This positioning\nis often a result of underdeveloped external rotators of the hip.\nPosterior-chain engagement contributes to safety because it promotes midline stabilization and balance about the\nfrontal plane. Also, keeping the knees in line with the toes reduces lateral and rotational forces at the knee joint\nThese forces are problematic for a hinge joint such as the knee, where associated tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and\nmenisci could be damaged when poor mechanics are allowed to go unchanged over long periods of time. It is less\nlikely that a single repetition causes significant damage to the joints, but thousands of repetitions performed over\ntime can wear on the knees\u2019 structural integrity.\nPressure in the feet\nA lack of posterior-chain engagement results in the athlete (and/or object) shifting excessively forward of the fronta\nplane. A trainer can see this by observing the center of pressure in the feet in all movements, especially with any knee\nor hip flexion. This may or may not occur in conjunction with the heel coming off the floor. The heel can remain on the\nground while the center of pressure shifts forward.\nThis may also indicate premature shifting of weight to the toes, especially during an explosive hip extension, which\nresults in the hip extending forward rather than upward. If an athlete jumps forward during a lift, it may be an indica-\ntion of a premature shift of weight to the toes. \u201cTriple extension\u201d is not a forced calf raise in conjunction with exten-\nsion of the knees and hips; it is achieved when the heels leave the ground because of, and after, a violent extension\nthereby creating extension of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Analysis of elite lifters shows that the longer a lifter\nremains in contact with the ground during the second pull, the greater the acceleration on the bar. Greater surface\narea in contact with the ground enables a greater force to be transferred."}
{"276": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nKnee position\nWith regard to knee position, although there are two directions the knees can travel to come out of alignment with\nthe feet (laterally or medially), the fault is usually seen when the knees collapse inward (medially). The degree of devi-\nation in knee alignment generally increases with increased hip and knee flexion in a movement and/or wider stances\nAn athlete with a poor knee position in any movement often produces the error to some degree any time the knee\nflexes. For example, an athlete whose knees collapse in a squat is likely to have the knees collapse to a less obvious\ndegree in running, box jumps, push presses, etc.\nSOUND HIP FUNCTION\nSound hip function refers to the athlete\u2019s ability to flex and extend the hip to maximize its contribution to a move-\nment. The hamstrings and glutes are powerful hip extensors. Powerful and complete hip extension is necessary for\nelite athletic capacity because:\n1. it applies the most force on the object, and\n2. it creates the most elevation on the object, giving the athlete the most time to accommodate or receive it.\nThere are no major safety issues with slow or incomplete hip extension.\nPoor hip function is usually expressed in one of three ways:\n1. muted hip,\n2. lack of hip extension, and/or\n3. slow hip extension.\nA muted hip never closes/flexes (and therefore is a \u201cpermanently\u201d open hip). If the hip never closes, the movement is\npredominantly driven by the quadriceps. The quadriceps extend the knee without contribution from the hamstrings\nand glutes. Lack of hip extension does not allow the power of the hamstrings and glutes to be fully expressed. This\ndoes not effectively put acceleration on the bar or object and therefore does not elevate it to any significant degree\nEven small deviations from full hip extension result in reduced power transmission. The speed of hip extension\nplays a critical role in accelerating the object being lifted, particularly when the object must be elevated far beyond\nits starting point (e.g., from rack to overhead). In all cases, the power of the musculature of the hips is not opti-\nmally expressed.\nACTIVE SHOULDERS\nAn active shoulder provides the most stable position for the shoulder when working against a load. This means an\nactive shoulder is present in the overhead lifts as well as the deadlift series, including the deadlift, sumo deadlift high\npull, and medicine-ball clean. Outside the nine foundational movements, active shoulders are found in the kipping\npull-up, ring dip, handstand push-up, row, and snatch, among other movements.\nActive shoulders are about scapular position and stabilization and require different actions by the athlete, depend-\ning on the movement. In each movement, the athlete attempts to keep the shoulder in a relatively neutral, natura\nposition, without yielding to a load. At the same time, he or she will create enough space between the anatomica\nstructures of the shoulder so they may pass freely without impingement. Typically, this means an athlete demon-\nstrates an active shoulder by applying force in the direction opposite the load. For example, in an overhead squat, the\nathlete pushes up on the barbell. In a push-up, the athlete pushes down into the ground. In a row, the athlete pulls"}
{"277": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nback to prevent the rounding of the shoulders. There are also cases in which an active shoulder is not achieved by\npushing into the load (e.g., bench press). In all cases, the retraction, elevation, etc. is not taken to the end range that\nresults in a contrived position. For example, retraction in a deadlift is not full retraction that may result in a loss of\nmidline stabilization or a position that would not be possible under any real load.\nAn active shoulder creates optimal skeletal alignment, which enables the most musculature of the torso (e.g., tra-\npezius) to aid in the stability of the shoulder and potentiate the greatest force. An active shoulder also moves the\nacromion process out of the way of the humerus, reducing the chance for impingement of the biceps tendons and\nrotator-cuff muscles. The chances for impingement increase as the grip narrows. In an overhead squat, for example\na wider grip requires less elevation to create clearance space.\nWhen an athlete loses an active shoulder, the direction the shoulders move (e.g., forward, down) depends on the\nmovement. The coach needs to observe from where the force is being applied and determine if the shoulders are\nmoving in that same direction (e.g., yielding).\nfuLL range of MoTion abouT a JoinT\nFull range of motion about a joint describes the natural anatomical beginning and end positions of a movement. Ful\nrange of motion allows a greater complement of musculature to be used (e.g., reaching full depth in a squat, using\nactive shoulders) and in some cases better mechanical advantage (e.g., bar resting on the body in the front rack)\nJoint safety is maximized by preserving the range of motion required by life while best distributing forces at any one\njoint or throughout a series of joints. Additionally, increasing the musculature and joints involved allows the athlete\nto develop the neuromuscular coordination that is universally found in compound movements and sport.\nToward the other extreme, hyperextension or artificially trying to create more range of motion past a joint\u2019s natura\nanatomical function can be detrimental to joint health; more is not always better.\nTraining to the full range of motion in functional movements best prepares an individual for any conceivable task\nWhile life\u2019s tasks may not always require full range of motion, training to the limits of one\u2019s natural end range prevents\ndeficiencies if and when the joints need to move the full range. Using full range of motion preserves joint health, flex-\nibility, and strength, reducing the chance of injury and decrepitude later in life. If there is not a more pressing safety\nissue that needs to be fixed first, a trainer needs to preserve full range of motion above much else (e.g., adding load\nincreasing speed).\neffeCTive sTanCe and/or griP\nThis refers to the foot and hand positions adopted during a movement, where the optimal stance and grip promote\ntask accomplishment and the ability to display all the movement\u2019s points of performance.\nThere are two common stances in CrossFit. A narrower stance (hip width) is used in the deadlifts, presses, and the\nOlympic lifts. The hip-width stance promotes a more direct transfer of force through the heels/floor and into the\nobject being moved. A wider stance (shoulder width) is used in squatting movements, allowing for greater depth\nand contribution of the posterior chain. Some force-transfer efficiency may be lost with the wider stance (relative to\nhip width), but function and range of motion are gained. It is possible to take a different stance to allow for different\nloading mechanics. For example, a wider stance is adopted in the sumo deadlift. This allows the torso to remain more\nupright, allowing the legs and hips to more readily assist the back during the lift."}
{"278": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nThe grip is usually outside the shoulders or hips so as not to interfere with the object or other points of performance\nbut it may also be wider if the demands of the movement require it. For example, the grip in the deadlift should\nbe wide enough so as not to interfere with the legs, but it is significantly wider in the snatch to reduce the overal\ndistance the bar must travel.\nIn many real-life applications with odd objects, a wider stance or narrower grip may be used. It is critical for athletes\nto learn how to apply the other points of performance, regardless of the stance and grip used to accommodate an\nobject. This is especially true of preparing an athlete for situations outside the gym, when a more convenient stance\nand grip are not always possible.\nThere are no major safety concerns from a lack of effective stance or grip except when other points of performance\nare adversely affected. The value of any stance and grip adjustment should be assessed based upon its effect on al\nthe other points of performance in the movement.\nASSESSING SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE\nSimply observing an athlete\u2019s position in a movement does not provide enough of a context to assess safety risk and\nperformance benefit. Both are assessed in light of the individual\u2019s:\n1. athletic capacity,\n2. loading,\n3. positioning, and\n4. speed of execution.\nA trainer cannot identify bad positions without this greater context. Decreased performance and increased injury are\nmore likely as the athlete moves further from a sound position or as loads increase relative to the athlete\u2019s maximum\nFor example, picking up a grocery bag with a rounded back is a common occurrence and contains little safety risk\nfor many CrossFit athletes. Nevertheless, this same positioning could be more problematic for a beginner deadlifting\n135 lb. or an advanced competitive athlete deadlifting 500 lb.\nIn daily training, athletes are encouraged to exercise using the correct positions to develop strength and awareness\nUsing sound mechanics promotes greater potential for power development and decreases injury risk in the long\nterm. Training in the best positions, regardless of the load present, develops a sound default motor pattern that\nbetter prepares athletes for loaded and high-intensity scenarios.\nBecause of the benefits to safety, efficacy, and efficiency, proper mechanics are a daily focus of CrossFit trainers\nWorking toward better movement is not only for beginners and is arguably more important as the athlete advances\nThe margin for error decreases as load and speed increase. Top competitors rely on efficiencies that can create\nseconds of gain. A trainer cannot settle for anything less than excellent mechanics. For example, an immature squat\nmay be a safe position, but if the athlete can learn to lift the chest, every degree of elevation can increase the loads\nthat can be lifted in a clean or snatch, for example. A trainer must challenge himself or herself to develop better\nathletes beyond their current capacity."}
{"279": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nConCLusion\nThese themes provide a template from which a trainer can evaluate all movement in order to maximize both safety\nand performance for his or her athletes. The ability to recognize and correct violations is essential for a trainer\nregardless of whether the athlete\u2019s violation is major or minor.\nUnderstanding these themes provides a template for evaluating other approaches to coaching a movement. These\nthemes also can help a coach think critically about any methods before including them in instruction: If there is not\na clearly demonstrable mechanism that creates a safer or more effective movement, it is usually an unnecessary\ndistraction.\nFor example, suppose a coach considers a new starting posture for the snatch or clean. He or she wants to use a\ndynamic start such that the athlete moves through the setup without a pause before the first pull. If the athlete\nis able to achieve the common themes (e.g., midline stabilization, posterior-chain engagement, balance about the\nfrontal plane) in a static start and there is no clear performance gain from a dynamic start (i.e., increased loads lifted)\nit becomes an unnecessary layer of complexity to add to the mechanics of the lift. Changes in movement mechanics\nshould be made when there are obvious gains in performance or a decreased risk for injury."}

{"282": "Heavy Days, continued\nHEAVY DAYS\nThere is the tendency for new CrossFit athletes and trainers to avoid heavy days entirely or execute them incorrectly.\nHowever, CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program. While people sometimes characterize CrossFit by its pro-\ngramming of mixed-modal workouts for time (\u201cmet-cons\u201d), this is a limited view. Days devoted to strength training\nare essential to CrossFit and are integral to CrossFit\u2019s prescription of constantly varied workouts.\nHeavy days are necessary to build top-end strength and power. Power output decreases with time, meaning that an\nathlete\u2019s work capacity in very short time domains sets the theoretical limit for his or her entire curve (Figure 1). It is\npossible to have high levels of short-duration power and little power elsewhere (e.g., a powerlifter), but it is impossi-\nble to have low levels of short-duration power and higher levels of longer-duration power. Therefore, heavy days are\nessential to a general physical preparedness program and should be used at least once a week or once every two\ncycles (where a cycle is three on, one off).\nfigure 1. Generalized work-capacity curve.\nHeavy days are not the only time athletes drive strength adaptations. Even within a metabolic-conditioning workout,\ndepending on the task and the capacity of the athlete, any number of exercises may build strength. Push-ups for\nnovices build pressing strength similar to a bench press, and attempting a 95-lb. thruster for a new CrossFit athlete\nbuilds squatting strength. As an athlete\u2019s strength increases, push-ups and 95-lb. thrusters tend to favor other adap-\ntations such as stamina, and greater loads are necessary to further increase top-end power.\nHeavy days can be completed with most any weightlifting or gymnastics movement, such as weighted dips and\npull-ups and lifting odd objects (e.g., sandbags, axles). More often than not, however, a barbell is best because it is\nimpossible to match the barbell\u2019s ease and range of loading with other equipment. Heavy days may also include all\nvariations of standard barbell movements (e.g., hang, power, from a deficit, pulling from pins/bumpers)."}
{"283": "Heavy Days, continued\nRepetition schemes\nThe heavy-day workout consists of small sets, most often in the range of 1 to 5 repetitions, where the total volume of\nworking repetitions is approximately 7 to 25. Repetitions significantly outside this range do not produce the desired\nresponse. If there are too few repetitions (e.g., one repetition of a near-maximum load), the athlete does not produce\nenough stress on the taxed muscles to drive a new adaptation. Conversely, too many repetitions (e.g., 30 or more\nrepetitions of near-maximum load) produces too much stress for the athlete to recover from in a reasonable time\nperiod. The working sets generally occur at or above 80\u201385 percent of a 1-repetition-maximum load, and warm-up\nsets used to get to this loading do not count toward the total working repetitions. This is not an exact percentage\nbut a working set should be heavy enough to require concentrated effort. The working sets also do not produce a\nsignificant cardiorespiratory response.\nRepetition schemes may vary. As a general guideline, the higher the repetitions in a set or across the entire session\nthe lower the loading. This tends to better develop muscular stamina and/or technique. The lower the repetitions\nthe higher the loading. This tends to better develop top-end strength. Both approaches should be used. Repetition\npatterns include standard schemes such as 7 x 1, 5 x 3, 5 x 5 (sets x reps); pyramid-like patterns of 1-2-3-2-1 (reps\nper set); descending/ascending schemes such as 5-4-3-2-1 (reps per set); no set specificity (e.g., work up to a max\npush press); and on-the-minute training (1, 2, or 3 repetitions on the minute, every minute for 10 minutes), among\nothers. Failed attempts count toward working sets. However, the goal of a session should be to complete the majority\nof the lifts.\nHeavy days are for everyone: the young, old, fit, and unfit. Using the concept of relative intensity, a trainer has each\nathlete lift a load that is relatively heavy for him or her. Even beginners should participate, although a trainer should\nbe more cautious progressing a new athlete in load. Trainers can potentially give beginners more repetitions (either\nwithin each set or by increasing the total number of sets) to very gradually progress to a reasonably challenging\nworking weight while instilling appropriate mechanics. Relatively new athletes often set a personal record every time\nthey lift heavy. As the lifter becomes more experienced, sessions without a new personal record may occur. Setting\na personal record is not necessary to reap the benefits of lifting heavy.\nMinimizing risk\nAs risk increases with load, the trainer has several safety concerns to manage when leading a strength session. A\nheavy-day class best begins with a thorough warm-up to prepare the athletes for maximal loading (e.g., increase\ncore temperature and improve range of motion). It also provides the trainer with an opportunity to correct and\nrefine mechanics across warm-up sets of the movement to minimize risk. Finding the best way to complete warm-up\nsets usually becomes an intuitive process as athletes become more experienced with lifting heavy. However, most\nathletes in their first few years still need direction through this section. Common practice for warm-up sets is at\nleast 3 to 5 warm-up sets, where the sets start with a lighter weight/higher repetition count and progress to heavier\nweight/lower repetition count. The rest periods in the warm-up sets do not need to be as long as during the working\nsets. Whatever the warm-up is, trainers cannot fatigue the athlete for the work sets. Instead, warm-up sets gradually\nprime the body for heavier loading while refining the mechanics of the lift.\nThe trainer must also teach each athlete how to bail and/or spot as necessary before any significant weight is\nattempted. It is easiest to have participants practice this with a PVC or dowel. A trainer cannot assume athletes\nwill perform bailing or spotting techniques correctly without specific instructions. The gym floor also needs to be"}
{"284": "Heavy Days, continued\narranged to ensure safe, walkable distance between working athletes, and the floor should be absent of extra equip-\nment. Trainers may choose to have participants share racks, in part to reduce equipment and space needs. Sharing\nracks also allows athletes to help one another with loading, unloading, and spotting. It also allows for adequate\nrest time between sets so athletes fully recover. When using racks, additional instructions are needed to ensure\nthat athletes keep enough distance between themselves and the racks when lifting. The trainer needs to clearly\ndescribe how the working sets should be approached to avoid confusion. For example, the workout may be 5 x 5\nfront squats. Does the trainer want the athletes to try to increase the load with every set? Does the trainer want the\nathletes to hold a certain percentage across all sets? Or does the trainer perhaps want the athletes to find a new\n5-repetition maximum, meaning the exact number of working sets is less important (maybe it takes 4 sets, maybe\n5 sets)? All these approaches have validity and potential benefits, but the trainer needs to indicate what the intent is\non a particular day.\nDuring the working sets, the trainer must appropriately apply the principles of threshold training just as he or she\nwould in any other workout. Once an athlete\u2019s mechanics significantly deviate from the points of performance, the\nload needs to be reduced. This is especially true when multiple verbal and visual cues do not result in any improve-\nment in mechanics. It is possible that the trainer can fix the mechanics at lighter loads and then allow the athlete to\nagain increase the load gradually. Deviations from points of performance may also require the trainer to change the\nmovement for a few repetitions before using the entire movement (e.g., using snatch pulls to correct an athlete who\nis pulling early in the full snatch). Once the workout is complete, the trainer should include equipment clean-up and\nworkout logging as part of the cool-down period.\nCueing during a heavy lifting session needs to be very direct. The athlete\u2019s attention will be almost solely focused\non the effort required to complete the lift. The trainer will have little time or opportunity to impact the quality of the\nmovement during the set. Therefore, cues need to be short, easy to implement, and delivered with an intensity that\nmatches the effort of the lift. If more technical consideration is needed, the time between sets can be a great oppor-\ntunity to elaborate. However, upon returning to the next set, the athlete should have a very clear picture of what he or\nshe needs to focus on. Giving your athlete more than one or two things to think about often results in no change at all\nConCLusion\nTrainers need to regularly program strength days with their clients and ensure all participants achieve the desired\nstimulus during the training session. These sessions provide coaches and athletes with opportunities to improve\nmechanics, acquire new skills, and see progress in a modality that is vital to developing the fitness CrossFit seeks."}

During the Level 1\nnutrition lecture, participants were walked through the importance of eating quality foods, and there was discussion\nof a few common ways to quantify food intake. Eating meats, vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and\nno sugar in combination with weighing and measuring macronutrient quantities can have a profound effect on one\u2019s\nhealth and performance outcomes.\nA tsunami of chronic disease has been sweeping across the world, and CrossFit affiliates are the lifeboats. Each gym\nhas within its walls the necessary ingredients to make profound changes to one\u2019s health.\nAs a coach, knowing what to eat, how to eat, and why it is important is only half the battle. The real struggle is in\nimplementing dietary changes and trying to create a high level of compliance.\nPerhaps one of the most important aspects of behavior change is one\u2019s belief that he or she is capable of making a\nspecific change. This is considered one\u2019s self-efficacy.\nIt is very important for coaches to know they have everything they need in the gym to increase an athlete\u2019s self-effi-\ncacy. Coaches should feel equipped to set up the perfect intervention to get athletes eating better for long periods\nof time, if not indefinitely.\nIt is up to the coach to help increase athletes\u2019 self-efficacy and encourage them to believe that changes are possible.\nIncreases in self-efficacy are a result of:\n\u2022 Mastery experiences: These are small achievable steps throughout the process. Success in these steps will\nincrease self-belief (i.e., adding vegetables to each meal).\n\u2022 A coach\u2019s ability to adjust to different emotional and physiological states: A coach must adjust to how others\nperceive change and deal with stress (i.e., be sensitive to the fact that Rebecca has always eaten this way,\nand she has three young children to consider).\n\u2022 Vicarious experiences: Coaches should use the successes of others to convince athletes that they, too, can\nbe successful (i.e., Joe started by cutting out low-quality food for a month. Then he would quantify only his\nbreakfast. Eventually, he measured his lunch, and six months later, he has lost 40 lb.).\n\u2022 Verbal/social persuasion: Athletes should receive verbal support from others, including from role models\n(the trainer) and/or in small groups (i.e., create an accountability buddy, send reminders, videos, articles\ncontaining any material that motivates the individual to stay the course).\nThese are four factors that affect self-efficacy (Bandura). These factors should be sought in combination with each\nother for best results.\nWhen thinking about behavior change within the context of a gym environment, we can understand the stages of\nchange as contemplation, action, and maintenance. These three stages apply most accurately to the gym environ-\nment and the relationship between coach and athlete."}
{"291": "Nutrition, continued\nContemplation: The athlete has a desire to make a change and recognizes that his or her behavior may be problematic\nAction: The behavior change has been initiated and healthier behaviors are being acquired.\nMaintenance: There is sustained healthy behavior and the athlete has developed the skills to deal with relapse.\nA key component to successfully changing behavior and progressing through each stage is self-efficacy. Does the\nathlete believe in his or her ability to change eating habits and to eat the optimal ratios and amounts?\nConTeMPLaTion\nA coach must first educate. Teaching the art of nutrition is no different than teaching functional movements. It stil\nrequires an in-depth knowledge of the material:\n\u2022 What are quality foods? What are unhealthy foods? How do you replace the unhealthy foods with healthier\nchoices?\n\u2022 How do you quantify macronutrients, and what tools are needed to weigh and measure?\n\u2022 Why is changing your diet important, and what are the expected outcomes?\n\u2022 What skills do you need to make this change and maintain it?\nCoaches then need to find the best way to communicate this information to their athletes. The explanation must be\nsimple, actionable, and realistic. This starts the process of building the skill set and producing the incentives required\nto make meaningful changes to diet.\nSuccessful gyms have accomplished this in a number of ways.\n\u2022 Small Nutrition Talks\n{ These talks are often provided during introductory sessions.\n{ Each small talk builds on the one prior. Athletes continue to develop knowledge and enhance skills\nin small steps (mastery experiences).\n{ Typically, food logs are used to determine necessary changes.

The assumption\nthat building a shopping list is easy is one of the reasons many do not succeed.

Some are very confident in their abilities.\nMaybe they have some past experience with being a high-level athlete, or they are very successful in other\nareas of their life. These experiences can be used as a way to sustain efforts necessary for optimal results.\n\u2022 That being said, the majority of the people who are trying to progress from sickness to wellness will have\nsome level of self-doubt, fear, or anxiety.\nA good coach is sensitive to the state of the athlete and finds ways to relieve stress and make the experience positive\nThis becomes very important in group nutrition challenges.

Consider the following:\n\u2022 Being part of a group can be extremely intimidating, especially if you are the least fit.\n\u2022 Successful coaches key into this right away and find a mentor to work closely with this type of athlete.\nMentors should be positive, relatable, and reliable.\n\u2022 Sometimes, the coach becomes the mentor and makes himself or herself available for extra guidance and\nmotivation.\naCTion\nOnce the athlete is ready to start, the coach needs to find ways to initiate change and keep it going. It is easy to\ncomplete a nutrition challenge and then fall back into old habits, eating the same way as before.\nVicarious experiences\nOne way a trainer can keep this behavior going is to provide vicarious experiences.\n\u2022 Find members that have had long-term success and use their stories.

{"297": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nPROGRAM DESIGN AND SCALING\nCrossFit is defined as \u201cconstantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity,\u201d with the goal to develop\nfitness that prepares one optimally for any task imaginable. The programming material of the Level 1 Course outlines\nworkout variables and basic considerations for structuring workouts. The programming material at this course builds\non that foundation by focusing on long-term program design for individuals and groups.\nAmong the myriad variables to control when programming workouts, a trainer cannot lose sight of the small influ-\nence programming has among a host of other factors that determine a client\u2019s success. Programming, whether\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d is secondary to effective coaching, appropriate scaling, using sound mechanics, and developing a\ngroup dynamic conducive to pushing oneself (i.e., highest intensity brought to the work). Even with less-than-optimal\nprogramming, a trainer who has a good eye for movement mechanics and develops a good rapport with his or her\nclients will help people improve their fitness for years. Functional movements performed at high intensity, regard-\nless of how well they are combined and varied, are powerful enough to elicit dramatic changes in one\u2019s health and\nperformance, particularly for the unaccustomed. Therefore, trainers can spend more time focusing on their skill set\nand member rapport rather than striving beyond reason to create the \u201cperfect\u201d template and programming cycles.\nANALYZING PROGRAMMING FOR EFFECTIVENESS\nEffective or \u201cgood\u201d programming produces results, and the relative degree to which programming is effective is the\ndegree to which it optimizes fitness. The standard by which to evaluate any programming is measurable improve-\nment in performance markers. For a CrossFit athlete, results would include increased loads on heavy days, decreased\ntimes on task-priority workouts, and increased repetitions or rounds on time-priority workouts. An optimal program\nwould see the maximum possible increases in any test of fitness.\nOther measurable markers include health markers. Faster Fran times, more rounds of Cindy, and heavier 1-repe-\ntition-maximum clean and jerks are correlated with decreases in blood pressure, triglycerides, and resting heart\nrate. Additional results may be reported by clients, such as improved quality of life, improved confidence, increased\nenergy, and mood alteration. Anecdotal improvements in quality of life are side benefits of CrossFit. While not mea-\nsurable, they are valued by many clients over the metrics of improved workout statistics and health markers.\nIneffective programming does not produce results, or at least not to the same degree possible with effective pro-\ngramming. These suboptimal results could include decreased performance on benchmark workouts, merely modest\nimprovements in performance markers, or even a higher rate of injury, which could be easily avoided by following\nother programming.\nThe key is that program effectiveness is based on results: real changes in measurable, observable, repeatable\nmarkers. Clients need to get results for the programming to be deemed effective.\nTrainers programming for a group or an entire affiliate can simply use the same measurement applied across the\nentire gym population. A trainer can look for long-term trends and patterns in the group by assessing performance\non select benchmarks. For example, a trainer may select specific benchmarks to follow: He or she may track clients\n1-repetition-maximum snatch, 1-repetition-maximum back squat, Grace, Fran, Tabata squats, 1-mile run, JT, Fight\nGone Bad, 5-km row, and Cindy as his or her fitness tests. An evaluation does not have to include these exact"}

As long as\nthe majority of members are improving their scores on these days, the programming is effective. A trainer must\nremember that this is a long-term view, and he or she cannot expect everyone to set a personal record (PR) with every\nbenchmark test due to variables beyond his or her control, such as mood, sleep, stress, the physiology of the athlete\nand even the athlete\u2019s commitment to the program. Intermediate to advanced athletes, for example, cannot expect\nto set personal records every time they repeat a workout due to the decreased magnitude of adaptations that result\nfrom increased proficiency (i.e., the learning curve).\nvarianCe in CrossfiT PrograMMing\n\u201cVariance\u201d refers to the intended variation of functional movements, loads, repetition schemes, and time durations\nwithin a single workout and across a series of workouts in order to best maximize one\u2019s fitness. Other factors (e.g.\nenvironment, gear) can be varied but are not the primary variables to consider. The variation of workout variables\nacross months and years determines how well one is prepared for any conceivable test of fitness. A program with\na narrow focus may show great results in one area but have little impact on another. For example, a powerlifting\nprogram may see increases in strength and power for certain lifts, but it might produce worse performance in lon-\nger-duration, higher-repetition scenarios or even decreased strength and power in certain other lifts, like the snatch\nIn the name of variance, there are few absolutes for formulating the infinite combinations of workout variables. An\nerror in programming variance is only problematic when the error becomes routine. Today\u2019s workout does not have a\ndramatic impact on one\u2019s fitness; it is the series of workouts that result in long-term change. Programming too many\nheavy days in a row, for example, develops a narrow capacity. Conversely, programming a few heavy days back-to-\nback on occasion may be an entirely appropriate or beneficial stimulus.\nLong-term planning and routine assessment\nEffectively combining workout variables over the long term requires intentional and careful planning. The program-\nmer must be well versed in CrossFit methodology to understand similar and disparate stimuli, as well as which\nstimuli are the most potent. Programming requires reviewing what has been completed recently in an attempt to\nprovide new variance. It must also allow for routine assessment to ensure progress is occurring.\nTo a lesser degree, the programmer must understand each athlete\u2019s current capacity and weaknesses. For any\nlevel of athlete, a well-varied program should cover many different aspects of fitness. As an athlete becomes more\nadvanced (e.g., a CrossFit Games competitor), additional time may be needed to improve weaknesses in addition to\nregular CrossFit programming. Regardless, effective programming cannot be random. Although CrossFit program-\nming appears random to some due to its non-linear and non-formulaic pattern, its variety is a result of a planned\nattempt to address all fitness tests. This does not happen by the luck of the draw.\nCrossFit.com programming\nCrossFit.com provides a great expression of variance for general physical preparedness. An athlete who can perform\nall main-site workouts as prescribed (Rx\u2019d) has a robust fitness capacity. Across all the workouts on CrossFit.com\nsome very broad trends suggest some combinations are more useful than others to develop this level of fitness\nCrossFit more frequently programs whole-body, natural, high-power movements in short, intense workouts because\nof their far-reaching effects on one\u2019s overall fitness. These principles are generally expressed in task-priority couplets\nand triplets of 15 minutes or less, which include full-body, high-power movements utilizing complementary functions\n(e.g., pulling vs. pressing).

{"299": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nprogrammer cannot be fooled into believing the simplicity of the movements and combinations equates to \u201csimple\u201d\nresults. Complexity does not inherently produce greater efficiency or efficacy, and arguably it detracts from both.\nClassic CrossFit benchmark workouts such as Fran, Helen, Diane, Elizabeth, and Fight Gone Bad are all excellent\nexamples of these basic principles. Fran (21-15-9 repetitions of thrusters and pull-ups) is an elegant combination\ntwo full-body movements, complementary in function (lower-body push and upper-body pull) to allow intensity to\nremain high while simultaneously expressing functions necessitated by life (squatting, putting an object overhead\npulling the body up).\nCrossFit programming is best summarized in World-Class Fitness in 100 Words, by CrossFit Founder Coach Greg\nGlassman: \u201cPractice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C & J (clean and jerk), and snatch. Similarly\nmaster the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips\nsplits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc., hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many\ncombinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly\nlearn and play new sports.\u201d\nAlthough many CrossFit workouts follow these trends, not all should. Less frequently, athletes need to be exposed to\nworkouts that are more unorthodox. For example, there are times when workout variables that result in decreased\npower output are entirely beneficial for an individual. A load that may be too heavy for an athlete to move con-\ntinuously in a workout is also a stimulus for greater strength. A high-repetition scheme that causes the athlete to\nstop multiple times in a single set is a stimulus for greater stamina. Even using lower-powered movements such\nas a Turkish get-up in a workout are useful occasionally for developing greater coordination, balance, and shoulder\nstrength under cardiorespiratory stress. The bulk of workouts, however, should strive for simple, bold pairings.\noPTiMiZing CrossfiT PrograMMing\nMost every client can improve his or her fitness without individualized programming. Small adjustments in the\ncontext of regular CrossFit programming, such as weakness work and scaling workouts appropriately, can accelerate\na client\u2019s results within general group programming.\nWorking weaknesses\nA weakness is a certain skill that is lacking relative to an athlete\u2019s proficiency in other areas. By improving one\u2019s\ncapacity in these weak areas, the athlete\u2019s overall fitness increases. Effective CrossFit programming by itself is aimed\ntoward improving weaknesses. With well-varied, unbiased combinations of loads, time durations, movements\netc., clients inevitably see improvements in their fitness for years. Over the months and years, just performing the\nelements one struggles with will improve one\u2019s proficiency in these movements.\nAn athlete may choose to do additional weakness work to accelerate progress and will likely find this also improves\nstrengths. Working on weaknesses is also important for clients who have reached a plateau. Coach Glassman has\nasserted the following: \u201cThere is more traction, more advantage, more opportunity in pursuing that one thing that\nyou don\u2019t want to see come out (of the hopper) headlong than to put more time into that thing you\u2019re already good\nat. That thing that you don\u2019t want to see come out is a chink in your armor. And addressing it will make a difference\nfor you in ways that you\u2019ll never be able to predict.\u201d"}
{"300": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nIt is unlikely that the programming needs to change drastically to address weaknesses, particularly for an affiliate\nor large group setting. Further, trying to tailor the program to every individual weakness is impossible. The best the\ntrainer can do is to observe and respond to the general trends in the gym and provide well-varied programming\nconsistently.\nConstant assessment is needed to ensure that too much capacity is not lost in the strong areas. When assessment\nhas shown that the weak areas are now at an acceptable level, the trainer should look to identify the next area\nof weakness and make small adjustments accordingly. A radical change in programming is likely to eliminate the\nbenefits experienced elsewhere (e.g., programming becomes too skewed toward the new goal).\nIf the programming becomes too skewed toward working on specific elements, then it is biased. Biasing is program-\nming certain elements more frequently regardless of current capacity in those areas. Biasing does not necessarily\nresult in an increase in fitness; it results in an increase in a specific capacity. Biasing is not necessarily negative if it\nserves the athlete\u2019s preference or goal. It is only a problem when the athlete is seeking general fitness and continues\nto follow a biased program. Addressing weaknesses may eventually become a bias in the absence of assessment.\nWeakness work can be easily included in the warm-up of the class, focusing on the technique of one of the more chal-\nlenging movements. This gives clients extra practice time to improve a deficiency and potentially allows for a more\n\u201cpersonalized\u201d program. During warm-up and skill sessions, which are often heavily biased toward newer and less\nproficient athletes, an effective trainer needs to also offer challenging options for the advanced athletes.\nFor example, suppose a trainer led a warm-up that included a skill session on pistols. Although most of the athletes\nmay be working on getting their first pistol, perhaps using a band or squatting to a box with a support, advanced\nathletes may be working on weighted pistols (e.g., with a bar in the overhead-squat position). There are examples of\nhow to use warm-ups to implement weakness work in the \u201cExample Warm-ups to Address Weaknesses\u201d section of\nthis training guide. With well-varied workouts, much of the warm-up can coincide with movement preparation for the\nworkout to practice elements that are usually weak (e.g., handstand push-ups, muscle-ups, double-unders).\nRegardless of the movements selected, trainers should be sure to avoid pre-fatiguing the client. The goal of the\nwarm-up is not to make it another workout. An example of a poor choice of warm-up may be doing three rounds of\n15 pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, and hip extensions before the workout Cindy (as many repetitions as possible\nin 20 minutes of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats). Pre-fatigue is of particular concern when a trainer plans\na longer skill session before the workout, such as handstand push-up skill work before the workout Diane (21-15-9\nrepetitions of deadlifts and handstand push-ups). Such skill work can be done, but the trainer must monitor the\nvolume such that the athletes are not unduly fatigued. Each athlete has variable tolerance to pre-workout volume\nrelative to that athlete\u2019s capacity. The tolerance builds over time, so the warm-up can eventually be more extensive\nwithout pre-fatiguing muscles.\nTemplates can be used for weakness work. They can help keep a coach or athlete committed to dedicating time to\nskill development. However, it is important for coaches and athletes to use their judgment to change or break from\nthe template as necessary.\nScaling effectively\nScaling workouts appropriately for one\u2019s clients is an essential consideration to best increase their fitness. This is not"}
{"301": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\njust a concept for beginner clients; an effective trainer progresses the most athletes toward completing workouts as\nprescribed across months and years.\nTo scale effectively, a trainer needs to review the original workout for its intended stimulus, including:\n\u2022 movement functions,\n\u2022 loading parameters,\n\u2022 time frame, and\n\u2022 volume of repetitions.\nThis does not have to be a formal process, but it helps identify appropriate scaling options.\nSuppose an affiliate decided to post the workout Amanda (9-7-5 repetitions of muscle-ups and 135-lb. snatches) for\nits daily classes. This is a workout most members at most affiliates have to scale. The basic analysis of the workout\nvariables shows:\n1. a high-skill gymnastics movement that is an upper-body pull and push and a high-skill weightlifting\nmovement that is predominantly a lower-body pull and squat,\n2. the intended loading is moderate,\n3. the intended time is short (approximately 5 minutes), and\n4. the volume is low.\nThe goal for scaling this workout is to adhere to as many of these variables as possible in light of the individual\u2019s\ncapacity. The resulting scaled workout still needs to provide each client with a significant challenge. There is no single\nstrategy that works in every situation. Scaling is also a \u201cmoving target\u201d as individual capacities change over time.\nThere are some populations for which a trainer can employ common scaling strategies:\n1. beginners and/or deconditioned individuals,\n2. intermediate athletes,\n3. advanced athletes, and\n4. injured athletes.\nScaling guidelines, and examples for the workout Amanda, are detailed below.\nBeginners and/or deconditioned individuals are generally those athletes who have been doing CrossFit for six months\nor less. For beginner and/or deconditioned individuals, a trainer needs to be primarily concerned with adherence to\nthe proper points of performance of the movements throughout the full range of motion. Increasing the difficulty\n(via movements or volume) and/or pushing for greater intensity (via speed or load) are secondary to developing\nmovement proficiency and new skill development. This group may often include the elderly, where additional safety\nconcerns may be necessary (e.g., keeping feet on the floor). Beginners need a lot of guidance: The trainer must be\nproactive about approaching them and modifying the workout.\nLoads, distances, and repetitions are the primary variables to modify during scaling, particularly before changing the\nmovement. If a movement is beyond the athlete\u2019s current abilities, a substitution should create a similar movement\nfunction and range of motion. In some cases, preserving function and range of motion can be done by using severa\nmovements to achieve a similar effect. Also, it is not \u201cstandard\u201d to increase the volume of the substituted or \u201cless"}
{"302": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nchallenging\u201d movement. For example, it is not necessary to always make those substituting single-unders for dou-\nble-unders complete two or three times the repetitions. This group often needs reduced volume, even with a substi-\ntuted movement.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for beginners/deconditioned individuals include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Reduce to whatever allows the athlete to best practice the movement with full range\nof motion. This may be a training bar, empty barbell, or even PVC pipe. If the athlete has to go very light\nto preserve movement mechanics, consider doubling the repetition scheme. This gives the athlete more\npractice repetitions, which is the primary concern for the inexperienced. It is also possible to reduce the\nrange of motion in a loaded scenario if the mechanics cannot otherwise be preserved. Regardless of the\nscaling choice, the workout should provide some challenge across the repetitions.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. Replace with a simple upper-body pull and push. Most likely, this will be jumping\npull-ups or ring rows, and squat-assisted dips, bench dips, or push-ups. These options are mechanically\nsimple relative to the muscle-up, so a trainer needs to pick an option that provides a challenge to the\nathlete\u2019s upper-body strength across the total repetitions.\nAlthough not an exact guideline, the term \u201cintermediate athletes\u201d generally describes those who have been doing\nCrossFit for six months to three years. An intermediate athlete is one who can perform some workouts as prescribed\nbut still struggles with more complex movements or challenging repetition schemes and loads. Scaling the repeti-\ntions on some gymnastics movements and the loads on some weightlifting movements is the main priority. A trainer\nmust be mindful that an intermediate athlete is best served by using different scaling options each time a particular\nmovement or load appears in a workout. A trainer can create several different options for intermediate athletes\nnot only to avoid boredom, but also to help them continue to develop their fitness. Varying the manner in which a\nworkout is scaled reduces the timeframe needed to acquire the desired adaptation.\nWith time, intermediate athletes should be able to adequately scale their own workouts. This comes with a better\nunderstanding of workout goals and their own strengths and weaknesses. Intermediate athletes may be incor-\nrectly neglected at times because they require less guidance than the beginner. Nevertheless, the majority of one\u2019s\nmembers will likely be intermediate athletes with a wide range of abilities. These athletes still need to be pushed to\nnew levels as appropriate.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for intermediate athletes include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Intermediate athletes often include individuals who should stay at the prescribed\nweight and potentially take longer to complete the workout. Although their power output may be lower\nthan if the load was scaled, keeping the load as prescribed helps develop exactly the strength and\nstamina needed to perform the workout in a more competitive time. In cases where this load would\nnot be completed in any realistic time frame (i.e., would take more than 20 minutes), reduce the load\nappropriately.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. The scale is best when it is specific to the weakness, and it therefore does not take\non one specific form. If they have significant upper-body capacity in pull-ups and dips, an effective scale\nwould be to work a transition drill, as that is where their capacity is lacking (i.e., working the transition\nhelps strengthen a greater range of motion at the shoulder). Conversely, an intermediate athlete who"}

Depending on proficiency, perhaps the\nrepetitions of pull-ups and dips should be increased. If there is an athlete who has muscle-ups but is not\nconsistent with them or cannot perform a high volume, reducing the repetitions is a viable option to help\ntrain the skill in a mixed-modal environment (e.g., repetitions of 5-4-3).\nAdvanced-level athletes are those who can perform all workouts and movements as prescribed. Typically, these\nathletes either came to CrossFit after years of performing some functional movements at high intensities (e.g., col-\nlegiate gymnast) or they have been doing CrossFit consistently for years. There are times a trainer needs to scale\nthis athlete due to sickness, injury, personal problems, or a recent string of difficult/demanding workouts. Occasion-\nally suggesting a variation with lower loading and/or repetitions benefits the advanced athlete both physically and/\nor mentally.\nThere may be an occasion to \u201cscale up\u201d an individual if the athlete is not challenged by the repetition scheme or weight\nor is in need of a different stimulus for skill development. The obvious options are to increase load or repetitions\nchoose different equipment (dumbbells vs. barbells), or make a movement more difficult (parallette vs. regular hand-\nstand push-ups). A trainer needs to be wary of this practice and should avoid consistently making workouts heavier\nand higher in volume to provide a \u201cchallenge.\u201d More often than not, the advanced athlete needs to be coached to\nbetter movement mechanics and/or greater intensity before making a workout \u201charder.\u201d An effective trainer needs to\nfocus on fixing movement inefficiencies and pushing for faster speeds before increasing the weights and repetitions\nThese corrections translate to seconds of gain in performance.\nCoaches need to be sure not to confuse advanced for elite, where elite is reserved for individuals actually going to the\nGames. Competitive programming is outside the scope of this course, as well as outside the scope of most affiliate\nneeds. At a minimum, athletes should be considered advanced before more volume is needed.\nSome potential scaling options for an advanced athlete in Amanda are listed below. There are infinite ways to tweak\nthe workout based on needs and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the athlete. These would be good options\nparticularly when an advanced athlete already has a competitive Amanda time.\n\u2022 Snatch.

These individuals should be encouraged to par-\nticipate in the workout, as there is benefit to training even in their reduced capacity. There is a positive hormona\nresponse from exercise, which can affect a multitude of factors, from body weight to recovery to mental state\nAlthough the nature of injury determines what is possible, the goal is still the same: to replicate all workout variables\nas closely as possible.\nPain-free range of motion is the main guideline. Where the movement cannot be performed exactly, a trainer should\nfind a substitute that best replicates the basic function and/or range of motion. However, any movement that stil\nrelies primarily on the injured joint/body part should be used cautiously, if at all. A trainer may need to get creative at\ntimes to help athletes avoid boredom and keep an injured athlete working for new skill acquisition."}
{"304": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nSingle-limb work can be utilized: Contrary to the belief that this results in a problematic muscular imbalance, exer-\ncising the non-injured side can reduce atrophy in the injured side. Dumbbells are a perfect tool for one-sided work\nand the number of repetitions can increase in cases where the loading is limited. However, this should not be the\nonly option for someone with an injured limb. If an exercise involves two movement functions, an athlete may stil\nbe able to perform one with both sides. For example, in a thruster, an athlete with an injured upper body might stil\nbe able to squat or front squat. If the athlete has an injured lower body, he or she might still be able to press or push\npress. If there are no reasonable options for an injured person to perform a similar movement, omit the movement\nor substitute something else. This should be the last option considered.\nUsing the workout Amanda as an example, scaling options for injured athletes would take on many different forms\ndepending on the injury. Here are a couple of examples:\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s shoulder is injured such that he or she cannot support any load with one arm.\nPotentially, the snatch becomes a heavy dumbbell snatch on the good side, or it could become a 135-lb.\nback squat; the load could even be increased to be more challenging in the 9-7-5 repetition scheme. The\nmuscle-up may become a single-arm ring row and push-up or dumbbell press.\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s knee is injured such that he or she has limited flexion. The snatch may become a\nsnatch variation (power, muscle, hang) depending on the range of motion of the knee. The muscle-up\nwould not have to be scaled.\nWhen the injured side is cleared to be used again, the trainer must increase intensity very gradually, with a heavy\nemphasis on maintaining optimal mechanics to prevent additional injuries.\nImplementing scaling in a class environment\nAfter a trainer has analyzed the workout and knows what is likely to need scaling (especially movement substitutions)\ndirection must be given to the entire class to help each individual to the appropriate modification. While this can be\ndifficult in a busy class setting, a lot of scaling confusion can be prevented when the trainer introduces the workout\nto the class by indicating the intended stimulus or goal of the workout. Loading, repetition, time, and movement\nconsiderations can be discussed.\nPresenting several scaling options at this time can help keep the class moving. Some gyms present set scaling options\nthat keep large groups organized. This is fine, but a trainer must also recognize that the best choice for some athletes\nmay be an entirely different option. An experienced trainer should have no problem creating unique scaling options\nas necessary without taking away from class instruction and group cohesion.\nThe trainer also needs to observe clients as they increase loads and practice the movements in preparation for the\nworkout. An effective trainer can quickly see if the movement loading and repetition scheme chosen for the workout\nare appropriate by watching warm-up sets. There are times when scaling may have been assessed incorrectly and\na trainer needs to scale after the workout has begun. If an athlete is struggling too early in the workout and will not\nachieve the desired outcome, the trainer needs to adjust one or more of the workout variables mid-workout (e.g.\nload, repetitions). This is mandatory if an athlete cannot maintain safe mechanics. In these instances, it is important\nthat the trainer is firm with his or her decision. If he or she has built a good rapport with athletes, they should have\nno problem with such adjustments."}

The general guideline is to add CrossFit volume\ncautiously while constantly assessing sport performance and being particularly cautious when an athlete is near in\ntime to an important event.\nPrograMMing ConsideraTions: CoMMon PiTfaLLs\nIf a programmer regularly assesses his or her athletes and observes the trends in data, he or she can quickly adjust\nineffective programming. Conversely, CrossFit programmers who do not regularly assess data can fall prey to\ncommon faults, some of which are described below.\n1. The first common error made by CrossFit programmers is a lack of regular assessment to determine\neffectiveness. Measurable results in performance markers are the guideposts for a programmer to\ndetermine whether the past programming was productive as well as what needs to be programmed next\nLack of assessment may occur from not repeating benchmark workouts and/or not recording results\nTrainers need to encourage members to record results to assist with this effort. Clients generally like this\nrecord of progress, particularly after months and years of hard work.\n2. Another error for CrossFit programmers occurs when variance is not applied correctly, and this is usually\nexpressed in one of three ways: randomization of workout variables, biasing certain variables, or emphasizing\nnon-essential elements. As mentioned above, optimal variance of workout variables requires intentiona\nplanning, not merely spinning the hopper and pulling out random tasks. A hopper may be used as a good\ntest of fitness (i.e., is an athlete ready for anything?), but it is not a good method to prepare for everything\nReliance on the hopper would leave to chance the broad, general, and inclusive adaptations CrossFit is"}
{"306": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\ntrying to develop. Programming via a hopper may be fun once in a while and can be used occasionally in\ncompetitions, but it is not a method by which to program for the best results.\nBiasing occurs when certain elements or combinations are repeated too often, with some elements avoided\ncompletely. There is nothing inherently bad about biasing as long as that is the intended goal. Biasing is a prob-\nlem if the goal is to develop general physical preparedness.\nAnother misapplication of variance is emphasizing non-essential elements. This appears as an endless\ncombination of workout variables, regardless of their utility or effect. For example, never repeating work-\nouts, performing lots of accessory or skill movements in actual workouts (e.g., Sots presses, single-leg work\nsport-specific drills), or focusing too much on environmental factors (e.g., working out with a gas mask or in the\nmiddle of the night) can be signs that variance is being misapplied. It can be easy for newer programmers to\nbelieve \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d programming provides a superior stimulus because of the novelty.\n3. A third common error in CrossFit programming is a lack of higher-skill development. This can occur when\ncertain movements are avoided in workouts or when warm-ups are not used to address weaknesses. A\ncurrent trend within the community is to avoid the more difficult gymnastics movements. CrossFit athletes\nare willing to tackle the technical weightlifting movements such as the snatch and clean and jerk but do not\nspend as much time developing the more technical counterparts in gymnastics, such as levers, planches\npresses to handstands, or pirouettes.\n4. CrossFit programmers may be tempted to use excessive volume. This occurs with more than one training\nsession a day (i.e., double days). In some cases, athletes may even attempt more than two sessions. This\npitfall affects those trying to emulate the volume sometimes used by CrossFit Games athletes. Games\nathletes\u2019 training is not representative of what CrossFit programming should look like. Multiple sessions a\nday are not appropriate for 99 percent of CrossFit athletes (less than one percent of those who participate\nin the Open go to the Games). Even multiple workouts in one extended \u201csession\u201d should generally be\navoided. Extra sessions and/or extra workouts may help performance in the short term but often lead to\novertraining, higher risk of injury, and burnout in the long term. Double days help Games athletes prepare\nfor high-volume competition and can help them get in more volume so they can advance certain skills\nrelative to their competitors. Generally, however, there is actually a decrease in intensity across sessions. As\nCoach Glassman said, \u201cBe impressed by intensity, not volume.\u201d If a client is looking to be competitive, very\ngradually and cautiously increase volume. For example, start with additional skill sessions (e.g., double-\nunder practice) in areas in which the athlete is not as proficient, not multiple workouts. Look at CrossFit\ncom and assess what the athlete cannot complete, then add \u201cvolume\u201d by way of working on these skills. The\nvolume should gradually increase over the long term.\n5. Another trickle-down effect from the Games is the assumption that the \u201cCrossFit standard\u201d for a movement\nis what is performed at the CrossFit Games. Standards in competition are set for ease of judging and do\nnot necessarily represent the best expression of the movement. They are used to establish the minimum\nrequirements for a repetition, and an athlete is held to those standards to ensure the range of motion is\nthe same across all competitors. Take, for example, hand-release push-ups: There is nothing better about\nthem in terms of muscular development or mechanical advantage. They are used because they are easier"}
{"307": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nto judge; a judge can easily ensure the chest and thighs make contact with the ground on every single\nrepetition. Standards in competitions should not prevent an athlete from using (or a trainer from teaching)\nmany different movement mechanics to develop a broad athletic capacity. There are different adaptations\nto all movements, and variations at the very least improve the overall coordination of an athlete who can\naccomplish a single task in multiple ways. CrossFit encourages athletes to learn all possible techniques and\nnot a single \u201cstandard\u201d (e.g., strict, chest-to-bar, kipping, and butterfly kipping pull-ups). This is another face\nof variance needed to develop the athletic capacity to accomplish tasks in multiple ways, and it is what wil\nbest prepare one for any test of fitness.\nConCLusion\nEffective programming occurs by applying basic tenets when selecting workout elements and combinations\nOptimizing long-term program design is best guided by observing results (i.e., objective and measurable change\nin performance markers) and applying focused weakness work or appropriate scaling. The elements of the daily\nworkouts are but one factor that affects how well an individual optimizes his or her fitness. Other factors, such as\neffective coaching and using intensity, need to be assessed to determine how best to make meaningful changes for\nimproved fitness."}

{"314": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nCLASS STRUCTURE AND LESSON PLANNING\nDuring the Level 2 Course, participants are led through a mock class from start to finish. It is meant to serve as a basic\nclass template for CrossFit affiliates. Although each example class at the Level 2 course is different\u2014from instructors\nto warm-up drills to workouts\u2014universally, there are themes that represent effective coaching practices.\nBeing a trainer is not about showing up, quickly writing a last-minute workout at the whiteboard, and turning on the\nmusic. Real training is about improving each client\u2019s fitness (and by association quality of life) in small, incremental\nsteps in a motivating and positive way. Besides having the presence, attitude, and demonstration skills to develop a\npositive rapport with one\u2019s clients (see \u201cFoundations of Effective Training\u201d), a large part of improving client fitness is\nhaving a plan, both on a day-to-day and long-term basis. This section discusses the basic but necessary components\na trainer needs to run a single class.\nTo effectively manage time, trainers need to have a lesson plan. A single class can be outlined as a four-part lesson\nplan consisting of:\n\u2022 Introduction\n\u2022 Warm-Up\n\u2022 Workout\n\u2022 Post-Workout\nThe total time of the workout helps set the allotted time for the warm-up and cool-down sections. A longer workout\nmeans sacrificing time in either or both. Most affiliates run hour-long classes, and this is the length used in the Level\n2 example class.\nLogistical considerations affect an appropriate workout to select, as well as the time allotted to each component of\nthe class. Factors include gear availability, class size, gym space (for equipment and athlete layout), and the expe-\nrience level of the class. A trainer needs to consider various alternatives because additional modifications may be\nnecessary on the fly, depending on the experience level of the clients and how many show up. For example, if the\naffiliate has limited floor space, it will not take many participants to make it cramped. For safety considerations, a\ntrainer needs to ensure there are walkable areas between all moving athletes and their equipment. Dumbbells are\na phenomenal tool for athletes; they are great space savers, as well as substitutes for barbells in many scenarios.\nTrainers may also use sandbags, the outdoors, staggered heats, etc. Trainers are limited only by their knowledge\nand creativity.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction, although the shortest element of a class, is of great importance. During the introduction\n(commonly referred to as the time \u201cat the whiteboard\u201d), the coach will brief the workout, set expectations by explain-\ning the intended stimulus, offer several scaling options, and take any questions. Generally, the introduction will take\nbetween two and four minutes, depending on the complexity of the workout and the number of participants taking\nclass. Having more participants increases the likelihood of questions. The introduction should serve to clear up any\nconfusion about the workout while also reducing pre-workout anxiety."}
{"315": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nWarm-up\nThe purpose of the warm-up is to do just that: warm the body in preparation for intense activity. Warm-ups often\nconsist of two parts: a general warm-up and a specific warm-up. The main goal of a general warm-up is to stimulate\nthe body\u2019s physiological functions\u2014i.e., increase core temperature and blood flow to the muscles, prime the car-\ndiorespiratory system, increase mobility, and move joints through a full range of motion. General warm-ups usually\ninclude calisthenic-type movements or movements that involve dynamic ranges of motion.\nThe primary goals of a specific warm-up are to build, practice, and refine proper mechanics for the movements that\nwill be used in the workout, and to prepare mentally and physically for the challenge. Specific warm-ups present an\nopportunity for movement assessment and appropriate scaling. However, potentially different ranges of motion\nand/or variations may be used (e.g., power vs. squat variations, medicine balls vs. barbells) where necessary.\nMovements that are not part of the workout may also be used in the warm-up, as the warm-up element also provides\nan opportunity to improve deficiencies in any movements (i.e., practicing handstands even though handstands may\nnot be in the workout). Typically, these options are reserved for shorter, lower-skill workouts that do not require a\nsignificant amount of time to prepare for (i.e., rowing 1,000 meters for time or running a timed mile). The \u201cProgram\nDesign and Scaling\u201d article discusses how to use this time as focused weakness work.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and coach in the warm-up period. The warm-up helps athletes best prepare\nto handle the demands of the workout and improve upon deficiencies, whether they are subtle mechanical ineffi-\nciencies in more experienced athletes or larger faults in movements with which athletes have little experience. The\nwarm-up also provides the trainer with an opportunity to assess the athletic capacity of an individual relative to\nthe intended stimulus. Following the assessment/practice period, it is time for the trainer to assign scaling options\nAlthough the trainer should have some ideas before starting a class, it isn\u2019t until after actually assessing athletes\nneeds that a trainer can choose the most effective option(s). As discussed in the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article\nscaling should progress with the athletes, and they should be constantly challenged (i.e., they should not just perform\nthe same scale every time a movement, rep range, or prescribed load is outside their current capacity). Beyond\nassessment and scaling, the warm-up is also the time for the coach to mentally prepare the athletes and oversee any\nremaining workout logistics (e.g., equipment distribution, equipment layout, heats, safety checks).\nA pre-workout break is not one of the main elements of a lesson plan, but it is needed and useful for a coach. The\npre-workout break includes safety and equipment checks, room layout, workout flow, additional scaling, questions\nfrom the athletes, a bathroom opportunity, and of course, the workout re-brief.\nThe workout re-brief is there to remind the athletes what the workout is (order of movements, repetition scheme\nand rounds or time) and the range-of-motion standards that are required. A coach needs to clearly demonstrate and\nemphasize the range of motion and mechanics for every movement before every single workout. This makes it easier\nto hold athletes to these standards during the workout and cultivate a culture of virtuosity in one\u2019s gym.\nWe must remember, especially for newer athletes, workout abbreviations and acronyms on the whiteboard are not\nself-evident. A coach may choose to discuss scaling options with the entire class at this time or even review the\nintended stimulus of the workout. This could potentially include describing the targeted time domain, loading, or skil\nacquisition. For example, the workout Elizabeth (21-15-9 repetitions of cleans at 135 lb. and ring dips) is a relatively\nshort workout (about 5 min.), with moderate loading. Novice CrossFit athletes likely have to reduce the load for the"}
{"316": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nclean to their level of moderate loading (e.g., 95 lb.), and they might have to address the dips\u2019 load (e.g., band, bench)\nor volume (e.g., 12-9-6) to best match the original workout intent. See the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article for\nmore information about preserving the intended stimulus.\nWhether in the pre-workout brief or the specific warm-up, time should be allotted for athletes to practice the exact\nstandards to be used in the workout. If the movement is loaded, additional time is needed for athletes to work up to\nan appropriate load under the discretion of the trainer.\nWorkout\nOnce the workout begins, the demands on a coach\u2019s abilities increase. Coaching is not about repetition counting\ncheering, or selecting music. It is about appropriately applying threshold training, which means pushing an athlete\u2019s\nintensity while maintaining sound mechanics. This balance is what helps minimize the risk for injury but also keeps\nthe intensity high to drive progress. Deviations in mechanics are inevitable as athletes try to move fast to complete\nthe workout. A coach must attend to each client, using as many different cueing strategies as possible or needed\nand offering encouragement and reinforcement of sound mechanics throughout the workout. A coach may find that\nhe or she actually has to slow an athlete down and/or lower the load, as well as potentially stop them, if there is no\nimprovement in mechanics across multiple repetitions. Movement change is not reserved only for the warm-up. It\nmust continue throughout the workout. A coach is expected to make athletes better during the workout.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and the coach during the workout. The athlete will receive increased fitness\nadaptations from appropriately increasing speed and load. In addition, he or she should be receiving feedback from\nthe coach on how to improve and refine movement. The coach benefits in this scenario by learning and developing\nseeing and correcting skills in a faster, more dynamic, and less-controlled environment. The ability to deliver action-\nable and effective cues for better movement improves with experience while coaching under high intensity. It is a\npractical, real-time learning opportunity that is focused on effective coaching strategies related to both the athlete\u2019s\nmechanics and motivation.\nPost-workout\nThe main purpose of the post-workout element is to cool down the athletes and program items that will aid in\nrecovery, regaining mental acuity, slowing heart rates and breathing, and facilitating full range of motion about the\njoints (i.e., regaining homeostasis). The coach may also have some secondary goals for this period, such as additiona\nskill work, fitness challenges, education for the athlete, and preparation of the space for the next class. Regardless\na well-conducted post-workout session must include a proper cool-down that leaves clients prepared for the rest of\ntheir day, capable and eager to return and full of appreciation for their accomplishments.\nSome examples of possible cool-down elements are described below. Generally, the cool-down should begin by just\nallowing the athletes to recover for a few minutes. While the athletes are warm and pliable, the cool-down is an excel-\nlent time to stretch or foam roll, especially the areas that were taxed heavily. This can aid recovery, reducing soreness\nwhile potentially helping athletes to gain new range of motion. A coach may leave this as an open period, allowing\nmembers to choose which drills are best for them. A coach-led session, however, ensures everyone has direction\nattention, motivation, and a sense of togetherness.\nA trainer may choose to include skill work at the end of a workout. This can include a review of the movements\nused, especially to correct errors that may have presented themselves during the workout. Using reduced speed and"}
{"317": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nload, the trainer can reinforce sound movement mechanics before the athlete leaves. If a trainer filmed an athlete\u2019s\nmovement during the workout, this period can include video playback to review his or her technique. It is also possible\nto work on a totally unrelated skill. While practice is more difficult after a workout due to fatigue, this is precisely why\nattempting new skills here can be beneficial (heightened neurological adaptations due to muscular fatigue).\nA post-workout may include a finisher\u2014an impromptu fitness test such as a maximum set of pull-ups, handstand\nwalking, or rope climbs\u2014anything. It can be part of an ongoing record or a competition, and it can be used as a moti-\nvational event or a chance to reinforce the unknown and unknowable nature of life\u2019s challenges. For example, finish-\ners may be grouped into teams or partners, or the challenge may be structured so one or two athletes compete at a\ntime and the rest of the class can cheer. As in a warm-up, a coach needs to be mindful that finishers do not become\na second workout, nor do they have to be part of every class.\nA coach can use the post-workout period to ensure athletes are recording their workouts. Especially on benchmark\ndays (including strength days), the coach should encourage members to write down their times, repetitions, loads\nand scaling or modifications. The coach should also be able to tell the members the last date the workout was com-\npleted for comparison.\nFinally, a coach can use this time as an educational opportunity to talk about nutrition, programming, scaling, \u201cWhat\nIs Fitness?\u201d or \u201cWhat is CrossFit?\u201d etc., all with the intention of creating smarter athletes.\nThe post-workout/cool-down period gives the coach time to survey athletes and look for mental faculties and visible\nsigns of injury or physical distress. A coach needs to pay attention to verbal and nonverbal cues that an athlete may\nbe under duress. This is also a time for the coach to engage in conversation with athletes by offering encouragement\nand feedback on performance and asking about their physical responses to the workout. Such conversations provide\nvaluable information about the coach\u2019s or facility\u2019s programming. These small connections also lay the groundwork\nfor building a strong community and meaningful relationships with one\u2019s members. The post-workout period is an\noften overlooked or rushed section of class, but it is valuable time, and a coach should use it wisely.\nTo be effective in each class, not only does a coach have to have capacity in all six areas discussed in the \u201cFoundations\nof Effective Training\u201d article, but one must also have a plan. This plan covers all aspects of the class to best improve\none\u2019s athletes with each training session while keeping them safe and excited to return for the next day. After each\nsession, an informal review and critique of one\u2019s own class performance can help the coach better prepare for sub-\nsequent sessions.

We sought to build a program that would best prepare trainees for\nany physical contingency\u2014prepare them not only for the unknown but for the un-\nknowable. Looking at all sport and physical tasks collectively, we asked what physi-\ncal skills and adaptations would most universally lend themselves to performance\nadvantage. Capacity culled from the intersection of all sports demands would\nquite logically lend itself well to all sport. In sum, our specialty is not specializing.\nPRESCRIPTION\nCrossFit is: \u201cconstantly varied, high-intensity functional movement.\u201d This is our\nprescription. Functional movements are universal motor recruitment patterns;\nthey are performed in a wave of contraction from core to extremity; and they are\ncompound movements\u2014i.e., they are multi-joint. They are natural, effective, and\nefficient locomotors of body and external objects. But no aspect of functional\nmovements is more important than their capacity to move large loads over long\ndistances, and to do so quickly. Collectively, these three attributes (load, distance,\nand speed) uniquely qualify functional movements for the production of high pow-\ner. Intensity is defined exactly as power, and intensity is the independent variable\nmost commonly associated with maximizing the rate of return of favorable adap-\ntation to exercise. Recognizing that the breadth and depth of a program\u2019s stimulus\nwill determine the breadth and depth of the adaptation it elicits, our prescription\nof functionality and intensity is constantly varied. We believe that preparation for\nrandom physical challenges\u2014i.e., unknown and unknowable events\u2014is at odds\nwith fixed, predictable, and routine regimens."}
{"5": "METHODOLOGY\nThe methodology that drives CrossFit is entirely empirical. We believe that mean-\ningful statements about safety, efficacy, and efficiency, the three most important\nand interdependent facets to evaluate any fitness program, can be supported only\nby measurable, observable, repeatable data.

Our\ncharter is open source, making co-developers out of participating coaches, ath-\nletes, and trainers through a spontaneous and collaborative online community.\nCrossFit is empirically driven, clinically tested, and community developed.\nIMPLEMENTATION We\u2019ve take\nIn implementation, CrossFit is, quite simply, a sport\u2014the Sport of Fitness.

{"8": "Aside from the breadth or totality of fitness CrossFit seeks, our program is dis-\ntinctive, if not unique, in its focus on maximizing neuroendocrine response, de-\nveloping power, cross-training with multiple training modalities, constant training\nand practice with functional movements, and the development of successful\ndiet strategies.\nOur athletes are trained to bike, run, swim, and row at short, middle, and long\ndistances, guaranteeing exposure and competency in each of the three main met-\nabolic pathways.\nWe train our athletes in gymnastics from rudimentary to advanced movements,\ngarnering great capacity at controlling the body both dynamically and statically\nwhile maximizing strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility. We also place a heavy\nemphasis on Olympic weightlifting, having seen this sport\u2019s unique ability to devel-\nop an athlete\u2019s explosive power, control of external objects, and mastery of critical\nmotor recruitment patterns. And finally we encourage and assist our athletes to\nexplore a variety of sports as a vehicle to express and apply their fitness.\nAN EFFECTIVE APPROACH\nIn gyms and health clubs throughout the world the typical workout consists of\nisolation movements and extended aerobic sessions. The fitness community from\ntrainers to the magazines has the exercising public believing that lateral raises,\ncurls, leg extensions, sit-ups and the like combined with 20- to 40-minute stints on\nthe stationary bike or treadmill are going to lead to some kind of great fitness. Well,\nat CrossFit we work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high-in-\ntensity cardiovascular sessions. We have replaced the lateral raise with the push\npress, the curl with the pull-up, and the leg extension with the squat. For every\nlong-distance effort our athletes will do five or six at short distance. Why? Because\nfunctional movements and high intensity are radically more effective at eliciting\nnearly any desired fitness result. Startlingly, this is not a matter of opinion but\nsolid, irrefutable scientific fact, and yet the marginally effective old ways persist\nand are nearly universal. Our approach is consistent with what is practiced in elite"}
{"9": "training programs associated with major university athletic teams and profession-\nal sports. CrossFit endeavors to bring state-of-the-art coaching techniques to the\ngeneral public and athlete.\nIS THIS FOR ME?\nAbsolutely! Your needs and the Olympic athlete\u2019s differ by degree not kind. In-\ncreased power, speed, strength, cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, flexibility,\nstamina, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy are each important to the\nworld\u2019s best athletes and to our grandparents. The amazing truth is that the very\nsame methods that elicit optimal response in the Olympic or professional athlete\nwill optimize the same response in the elderly. Of course, we cannot load your\ngrandmother with the same squatting weight that we would assign an Olympic\nskier, but they both need to squat. In fact, squatting is essential to maintaining\nfunctional independence and improving fitness. Squatting is just one example\nof a movement that is universally valuable and essential yet rarely taught to any\nbut the most advanced of athletes. This is a tragedy. Through painstakingly thor-\nough coaching and incremental load assignment, CrossFit has been able to teach\neveryone who can care for himself or herself to perform safe-\nly and with maximum efficacy the same movements typically\nutilized by professional coaches in elite and certainly exclusive\nenvironments.\nWHO HAS BENEFITED FROM CROSSFIT?\nMany professional and elite athletes are participating in CrossFit.\nPrizefighters, cyclists, surfers, skiers, tennis players, triathletes\nand others competing at the highest levels are using CrossFit to\nadvance their core strength and conditioning, but that is not all.\nCrossFit has tested its methods on the sedentary, overweight,\npathological, and elderly and found that these special popula-\ntions met the same success as our stable of athletes.

{"10": "JUST WHAT IS A \u201cCORE STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING\u201d PROGRAM?\nCrossFit is a core strength and conditioning program in two distinct senses. First,\nwe are a core strength and conditioning program in the sense that the fitness\nwe develop is foundational to all other athletic\nneeds. This is the same sense in which the uni-\nversity courses required of a particular major\nare called the \u201ccore curriculum.\u201d This is the stuff\nthat everyone needs. Second, we are a \u201ccore\u201d\nstrength and conditioning program in the literal\nsense meaning the center of something. Much\nof our work focuses on the major functional axis\nof the human body, the extension and flexion\nof the hips and torso or trunk. The primacy of\ncore strength and conditioning in this sense is\nsupported by the simple observation that pow-\nerful hip extension alone is necessary and near-\nly sufficient for elite athletic performance. That\nis, our experience has been that no one without\nthe capacity for powerful hip extension enjoys\ngreat athletic prowess and nearly everyone we\nhave met with that capacity was a great athlete.\nRunning, jumping, punching, and throwing all\noriginate at the core. At CrossFit we endeavor\nto develop our athletes from the inside out, from core to extremity, which is, by\nthe way, how good functional movements recruit muscle, from the core to the\nextremities.\nCAN I ENJOY OPTIMAL HEALTH WITHOUT BEING AN ATHLETE?\nNo! Athletes experience a protection from the ravages of aging and disease that\nnon-athletes never find. For instance, 80-year-old athletes are stronger than\nnon-athletes in their prime at 25 years old. If you think that strength is not import-\nant, consider that strength loss is what puts people in nursing homes.

{"11": "WHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO BE AN ATHLETE; I JUST WANT TO BE HEALTHY?\nYou are in luck. We hear this often, but the truth is that fitness, wellness, and pa-\nthology (sickness) are measures of the same entity: your health. There are a mul-\ntitude of measurable parameters that can be ordered from sick (pathological) to\nwell (normal) to fit (better than normal). These include but are not limited to blood\npressure, cholesterol, heart rate, body fat, muscle mass, flexibility, and strength.\nIt seems as though all of the body functions that can go awry have states that are\npathological, normal, and exceptional and that elite athletes typically show these\nparameters in the exceptional range. CrossFit\u2019s view is that fitness and health are\nthe same thing (see \u201cWhat Is Fitness? (Part 1)\u201d article). It is also interesting to notice\nthat the health professional maintains your health with drugs and surgery, each\nwith potentially undesirable side effects, whereas the CrossFit trainer typically\nachieves a superior result always with \u201cside benefit\u201d versus side effect.\nEXAMPLES OF CROSSFIT EXERCISES\nBiking, running, swimming, and rowing in an endless variety of drills. The clean and\njerk, snatch, squat, deadlift, push press, bench press, and power clean. Jumping,\nmedicine-ball throws and catches, pull-ups, dips, push-ups, handstands, presses\nto handstands, pirouettes, kips, cartwheels, muscle-ups, sit-ups, scales, and holds.\nWe make regular use of bikes, the track, rowing shells and ergometers, Olympic\nweight sets, rings, parallel bars, free exercise mats, horizontal bars, plyometrics\nboxes, medicine balls, and jump ropes.\nThere is not a strength and conditioning program anywhere that works with a\ngreater diversity of tools, modalities, and drills.\nWHAT IF I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF THIS?\nIt is a common sentiment to feel that because of the obligations of career and fami-\nly that you do not have the time to become as fit as you might like. Here is the good\nnews: World-class age group strength and conditioning is obtainable through an\nhour a day six days per week of training.

{"12": "physical skills (cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, flexibility, strength,\npower, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy). The excessive aero-\nbic volume of the endurance athletes\u2019 training costs them in speed, power, and\nstrength to the point that their athletic competency has been compromised. No\ntriathlete is in ideal shape to wrestle, box, pole-vault, sprint, play any ball sport,\nfight fires, or do police work. Each of these requires a fitness level far beyond the\nneeds of the endurance athlete. None of this suggests that being a marathoner,\ntriathlete or other endurance athlete is a bad thing; just do not believe that training\nas a long-distance athlete gives you the fitness that is prerequisite to many sports.\nCrossFit considers the sumo wrestler, triathlete, marathoner, and powerlifter to\nbe \u201cfringe athletes\u201d in that their fitness demands are so specialized as to be incon-\nsistent with the adaptations that give maximum competency at all physical chal-\nlenges. Elite strength and conditioning is a compromise between each of the 10\nphysical adaptations. Endurance athletes do not balance that compromise.\nAEROBICS AND ANAEROBICS\nThere are three main energy systems that fuel all human activity. Almost all chang-\nes that occur in the body due to exercise are related to the demands placed on\nthese energy systems. Furthermore, the efficacy of any given fitness regimen may\nlargely be tied to its ability to elicit an adequate stimulus for change within these\nthree energy systems.\nEnergy is derived aerobically when oxygen is utilized to metabolize substrates de-\nrived from food and liberates energy. An activity is termed aerobic when the ma-\njority of energy needed is derived aerobically.

{"13": "It warrants mention that in any activity all three energy systems are utilized\nthough one may dominate. The interplay of these systems can be complex, yet a\nsimple examination of the characteristics of aerobic versus anaerobic training can\nprove useful.\nCrossFit\u2019s approach is to judiciously balance anaerobic and aerobic exercise in a\nmanner that is consistent with the athlete\u2019s goals. Our exercise prescriptions ad-\nhere to proper specificity, progression, variation, and recovery to optimize\nadaptations.\nTHE OLYMPIC LIFTS, A.K.A., WEIGHTLIFTING\nThere are two Olympic lifts, the clean and jerk and\nthe snatch. Mastery of these lifts develops the\nsquat, deadlift, power clean, and split jerk while\nintegrating them into a single movement of un-\nequaled value in all of strength and conditioning.\nThe Olympic lifters are without a doubt the world\u2019s\nstrongest athletes.\nThese lifts train athletes to effectively activate more\nmuscle fibers more rapidly than through any other\nmodality of training. The explosiveness that results\nfrom this training is of vital necessity to every sport.\nPracticing the Olympic lifts teaches one to apply\nforce to muscle groups in proper sequence; i.e.,\nfrom the center of the body to its extremities (core\nto extremity). Learning this vital technical lesson benefits all athletes who need\nto impart force to another person or object, as is commonly required in near-\nly all sports.\nIn addition to learning to impart explosive forces, the clean and jerk and snatch\ncondition the body to receive such forces from another moving body both safely"}

This places a unique premi-\num on the improvement of strength-to-weight ratio. Unlike other strength training\nmodalities, gymnastics and calisthenics allow for increases in strength only while\nincreasing strength-to-weight ratio!\nGymnastics develops pull-ups, squats, lunges, jumping, push-ups, and numerous\npresses to handstand, scales, and holds. These skills are unrivaled in their benefit\nto the physique, as evident in any competitive gymnast.\nAs important as the capacity of this modality is for strength development, it is with-\nout a doubt the ultimate approach to improving coordination, balance, agility, ac-\ncuracy, and flexibility. Through the use of numerous presses, handstands, scales,\nand other floor work, the gymnast\u2019s training greatly enhances kinesthetic sense.\nThe variety of movements available for inclusion in this modality probably exceeds\nthe number of exercises known to all non-gymnastic sport! The rich variety here\ncontributes substantially to CrossFit\u2019s ability to inspire great athletic confidence\nand prowess.\nFor a combination of strength, flexibility, well-developed physique, coordina-\ntion, balance, accuracy, and agility, the gymnast has no equal in the sports world.\nThe inclusion of this training modality is absurdly absent from nearly all train-\ning programs.\nROUTINES\nThere is no ideal routine! In fact, the chief value of any routine lies in abandon-\ning it for another. The CrossFit ideal is to train for any contingency. The obvious\nimplication is that this is possible only if there is a tremendously varied quality to\nthe breadth of stimulus.

{"18": "WHAT SHOULD I EAT?\nIn plain language, base your diet on garden vegetables (especially greens), meats,\nnuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar. That is about as simple as we\ncan get. Many have observed that keeping your grocery cart to the perimeter of the\ngrocery store while avoiding the aisles is a great way to protect your health.

Coronary heart disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoporo-\nsis, obesity, and psychological dysfunction have all been scientifically linked to a\ndiet too high in refined or processed carbohydrate. The caveman model is perfect-\nly consistent with CrossFit\u2019s prescription.\nWHAT FOODS SHOULD I AVOID?\nExcessive consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates is the primary culprit in\nnutritionally caused health problems. High-glycemic carbohydrates are those that\nraise blood sugar too rapidly. They include rice, bread, candy, potato, sweets, so-\ndas, and most processed carbohydrates. Processing can include bleaching, bak-\ning, grinding, and refining. Processing of carbohydrates greatly increases their\nglycemic index, a measure of their propensity to elevate blood sugar.\nWHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH HIGH-GLYCEMIC CARBOHYDRATES?\nThe problem with high-glycemic carbohydrates is that in excess they give an inor-\ndinate insulin response. Insulin is an essential hormone for life, yet acute, chron-\nic elevation of insulin leads to hyperinsulinism, which has been positively linked\nto obesity, elevated cholesterol levels, blood pressure, mood dysfunction, and a\nPandora\u2019s box of disease and disability.

Powerlifting is a superb start to a lifting pro-\ngram followed later by the more dynamic clean and the jerk and finally the clean\nand jerk and the snatch.\nThe movements that we are recommending are very demanding and very athletic.\nAs a result they have kept athletes interested and intrigued where the typical fare\noffered in most gyms (bodybuilding movements) typically bores athletes to dis-\ntraction. Weightlifting is sport; weight training is not.\nTHROWING\nOur program includes not only weightlifting and powerlifting but also throwing\nwork with medicine balls.

Sport is the application of fitness in a fan-\ntastic atmosphere of competition and mastery. Training efforts typically include\nrelatively predictable repetitive movements and provide limited opportunity for\nthe essential combination of our 10 general physical skills. It is, after all, the com-\nbined expression, or application, of the 10 general skills that is our motivation for\ntheir development in the first place. Sports and games like soccer, martial arts,\nbaseball, and basketball, in contrast to our training workouts, have more varied\nand less predictable movements. But, where sports develop and require all 10\ngeneral skills simultaneously, they do so slowly compared to our strength and con-\nditioning regimen. Sport is better, in our view, at expression and testing of skills\nthan it is at developing these same skills. Both expression and development are\ncrucial to our fitness.

They produced a list of physiological adaptations that represented\nthe gamut of potential physiological adaptations in an exercise program. You\ncan improve cardiorespiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power,\nspeed, coordination, accuracy, agility and balance by exercising. They gave rea-\nsonable definitions to each of these 10 so that they seemed fairly distinct. Keep\nin mind, however, nature has no obligation to recognize these distinctions.

{"36": "We have countless examples of this from amateur and professional sports. At the\nheart of this is that we have learned some things about GPP that the world never\nknew before. There is more opportunity of advancing athletic performance via\nadvancing GPP than there is in more sport-specific strength and conditioning\ntraining. For example, I am not sure why more pull-ups make for better skiers,\nbut they do. We have some theories why that occurs, but we do not actually need\nto know the mechanism. We are focused on advancing performance.\nSo the second model is a statistical model using skills and drills. I am looking for a\nbalance of capacity across training modalities.\nThe third model uses the three metabolic pathways. These are the three engines\nthat produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the currency of effort of all energy\noutput. Power is plotted on the Y-axis and duration of effort (time) on the X-axis.\nThe first pathway (phosphagen or phosphocreatine) is high powered and short\nduration. It can account for about 100 percent of max human output and taps out\nat about 10 seconds. The second pathway (lactate or glycolytic) is moderate pow-\nered, moderate duration. It accounts for approximately 70 percent of max pow-\ner output, peaks at about 60 seconds and terminates at 120 seconds. The third\npathway (oxidative or aerobic) is low powered, long duration. It accounts for ap-\nproximately 40 percent of max power output and does not fade in any reasonable\ntime for which I have the patience to measure. The phosphagen and the glycolytic\npathways are anaerobic; oxidative is aerobic. All three engines work all the time to\nsome extent. The degree to which each is active is dependent on the activity. One\nidles, while the other two rev; two will rev, one will idle, etc.\nOur thought is this: He or she is as fit as he or she is balanced in capacity in all\nthree of these engines. A human being is a vehicle with three engines. Suppose we\ndiscover there is a fourth engine; we want capacity there, too. We develop capacity\nin all engines through our prescription: constantly varied functional movement\nexecuted at high intensity.

For example, maximal oxygen\nconsumption (VO2 max) and lactate threshold are correlates, maybe components,\nbut absolutely subordinate to what happens to work capacity. Who would take an\nincrease in VO2max for a decrease in work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains?

This would be similar to a group of athletes competing in 25\nto 30 workouts.

This means measurable, observ-\nable, repeatable data is used in analyzing and assessing a fitness program. There\nare three meaningful components to analysis of a fitness program: safety, efficacy,\nand efficiency.\nThe efficacy of a program means, \u201cWhat is the return?\u201d Maybe a fitness program\nadvertises that it will make you a better soccer player.

And people were like: \u201cYou are kidding me?\u201d and \u201cFat makes you fat, right?\u201d\nIt is not true.\nOPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE\nThe next layer to diet is about optimizing performance. Through a diet of meat\nand vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, no sugar, you will not be\nso lucky as to optimize your output. To get a sub-three-minute Fran, you need to\nweigh and measure your meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, fruit and starch,\nand you need to eliminate sugar.\nI wish it were not true. I wish the path of fitness was riding bicycles and drinking\nbeer. I wished that is how we did it. It does not work. What you have to do is eat\nmeat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, no sugar, and then\nget a scale and measuring cup. You need accuracy and precision to your consump-\ntion or you will never get in a jet stream of elite performance.\nIf you want to have top-fuel-type performance, you need top fuel. I wish it were\notherwise. What do I base this on? No one has ever demonstrated to me anything\nbut inferior capacity on a diet where they did not weigh and measure.\nI am not telling you that you have to weigh and measure your food. But I am telling\nyou that you are not going to get anywhere in terms of optimizing your perfor-\nmance on a bad diet. And we have seen enough incidences now. I have worked\nwith tens of thousands of people: No one has ever done it.\nYou need to weigh and measure your food. Not forever, but at least to start. It is\nalso good to go back to weighing and measuring once in a while. What happens is"}
{"51": "further. It is possible you will get too lean to perform well. You may find a plateau in\nyour output, and then you need to ratchet it up. (I do the same thing for hard gain-\ners; I increase their intake as I do not need them to lean out.) The first step: When\nyou get as lean as you want to be and before there is a diminution in performance,\ndouble the fat. If you do not feel a whole lot better, maybe try three times the fat.\nAnd if that does not feel a whole lot better, and instead you just get thicker, then go\nback to two times the fat. But I would let performance tell me what to do. In making\nmodifications, I want to see any kind of change in physiognomy. I have more room\nto play with when someone has extra padding; I have to be more careful with\nsomeone who is already ripped.\nThe formula for calculating what is relevant and pertinent to your prescription is\nlean body mass and activity level. Done. There is not an inherent difference for\nmen versus women, for young versus old. I want to know how active you are and\nI want to know what your lean body mass is. And everything else is not germane,\nnot pertinent, not relevant. It is extraneous information.\nIn the vagaries and contingencies of everyday living, such as schedules and appe-\ntite, there are fluctuations in intake that will occur without weighing and measur-\ning. Following these normal fluctuations puts you on a coarser path versus the fine\npath required for optimized performance. And that is why you will not get there by\nluck. It is also possible an average CrossFit athlete becomes extraordinary this way.\nCommitment and focus are going to overcome genetic limitations. If you commit\nto the effort, you stand a much better chance. We have had this fantastic experi-\nence of playing with this. In any cohort, one pulls away when he or she is weighing\nand measuring food in this 40-30-30 milieu of macronutrient intake."}
{"52": "FITNESS, LUCK AND HEALTH\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s Feb. 27, 2016, L1 lecture in San Jose, California; March 27,\n2016, L1 lecture in Aromas, California; and April 24, 2016, L1 lecture in Oakland, California.\nIn 2002, we observed that almost any health parameter sits well ordered on a con-\ntinuum of values that ranged from sick to well to fit. High-density lipoproteins (HDL\ncholesterol), for instance: At less than 35 mg/dL you have a problem, 50 mg/dL is\nnice, and 75 mg/dL is a whole lot better. Blood pressure: 195/115 mm/Hg you have\na problem, 120/70 mm/Hg is healthy, and 105/50 mm/Hg looks more like an ath-\nlete. Triglycerides, bone density, muscle mass, body fat, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c,\naka glycated hemoglobin)\u2014all can be plotted relative to these three values.\nThe significance is that these are the predictors, the cause, and the manifesta-\ntion of chronic disease. Chronic diseases include obesity, coronary heart disease,\nType 2 diabetes, stroke, cancer (to include breast, colon and lung, but my theory\nis this will include all the positron-emission-tomography-positive cancers eventu-\nally, which are 95 percent of all cancers), Alzheimer\u2019s, peripheral artery disease,\nadvanced biological aging, drug addiction, among others.\nIt is very likely that if you have any chronic disease, you have deranged markers. If\nyou have Alzheimer\u2019s, you would see your HDL suppressed, your blood pressure\nup, your triglycerides up, your body fat up, your muscle mass down, your bone\ndensity down, your HbA1c high, etc. The same is true with diabetes. The same is\ntrue with most cancers.\nMedicine has no effective treatment for chronic disease: It is symptomatic only.\nThe doctor gives you a drug to bring your cholesterol down, a different drug to\nraise your bone density. You might need bariatric surgery if you have morbid obe-\nsity. If you have paved-over coronary arteries, they can do bypass surgery. If you\nbecome glucose intolerant, the doctor can put you on insulin. But all of these are\nnot fixes. They are masking the problem. If you have persistent malignant hyper-\ntension, you should take an antihypertensive if you cannot get your blood pres-"}

The numbers are ris-\ning, and when we finally add the positron-emission-tomography-positive cancers\nin, the number might be 80-85 percent in the U.S. It is estimated by the Centers for\nDisease Control (CDC) that the U.S. could have up to a hundred million diabetics in\n2050. That will affect everyone. You will not go into the emergency room for some-\nthing as simple as a broken arm: You will be seeing heart attacks on every corner.\nMedicine has no solution; you do. CrossFit, with meat and vegetables, nuts and\nseeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar, will help you avoid all of this.\nThe other 30 percent are dying from accidents that come in four \u201c-ic\u201d variants: ki-\nnetic, genetic, toxic, and microbic. Kinetic: physical trauma, car crash, hit on a bike.\nToxic: environmental toxins, such as lead poisoning. Genetic: genetic disorders like\ncystic fibrosis, you are born with it. Microbic: virus, bacteria, prions. This is where\ntreatment can be symptomatic. This is where the miracles of medicine are. If you\nhave got a genetic disorder that is making you sick, you need a doctor. If you have\nbeen poisoned, you need a doctor. If you caught a nasty virus or a flesh-eating\nbacteria, you need a doctor. You do not need to go to the gym, and you do not need\nburpees. Doctors are like lifeguards; CrossFit trainers are like swim coaches. When\nyou are drowning, you do not need a swim coach. You needed one, and you did not\nget one. What you need is a lifeguard. We will teach people how to swim, and when\nthey do not pay attention, and they go under, the doctors take care of it.\nAccidents are largely stuff you can do nothing about, but there is one exception. Be\nfit. Kinetic: We hear stories from war of CrossFit athletes who survive things that\npeople have not survived previously. Toxicity: Someone who is fitter is more likely\nto survive the same poisoning than someone who is not. Genetic: There are genes\nyou have inherited that will or will not express because of your behavior through\ndiet and exercise. Microbic: Who is most vulnerable to viral pneumonia? The frail,\nthe feeble. So fitness offers a protection here.\nBut assume there is no protection from fitness because what you need in terms\nof preventing accidents largely is luck. Luck\u2014there is no \u201cgood luck\u201d versus \u201cbad\nluck\u201d\u2014looks like not having these things happen to you. Seventy percent of what"}

We have hacked health. Here is the magic formula for you:\nFitness + Luck (bad) = Health.\nIt is the part you can do something about plus the part you can do nothing about\nthat sums to your outcome. So make the most out of fitness and you will not be\npart of the seven out of 10 who die unnecessarily due to lifestyle. In the end, chron-\nic disease is a deficiency syndrome. It is sedentation with malnutrition.\nThe cost of chronic disease is such that U.S. medical expenditure is now about\n$4 trillion a year. In 2008, Pricewaterhousecoopers estimated that roughly half of\nall U.S. medical expenditure was wasted on unnecessary procedures, administra-\ntive inefficiencies, treatment of preventable conditions and so on. Add in fraud\nand abuse and we are wasting well more than a trillion dollars. We also know 86\npercent of overall health-care spending goes to treating the chronically diseased\nineffectively. Of the remaining 14 percent, half goes to the stuff that medicine can\nactually do something about. That means seven percent of health-care spending\nis not wasted. The amount spent on chronic disease is a waste.\nWhat CrossFit trainers are providing is non-medical health care. When doctors\ntreat those affected by accidents (the 30 percent), that is medical health care. If\nyou are confused about the two, it is easy to distinguish by methods and tools. If\nsomeone is cut open, given radiation, prescribed pills, injected with syringes, it is\nmedicine. It is treatment by a doctor.\nOn our side, it looks like CrossFit. We have rings, dumbbells, pull-up bars, our own\nbodies\u2014and the prescription is universal. It is not to treat disease. It does not mat-\nter where you fall on this continuum: You get put on the same program. If the pre-\nscription is universal, it cannot be medicine.

{"67": "TYPICAL CROSSFIT BLOCK PRESCRIPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS\nTo best understand the Zone Diet, CrossFit athletes should read Dr. Barry Sears\u2019\nbook \u201cEnter the Zone.\u201d This article gives more information regarding block pre-\nscriptions and fat adjustments for CrossFit athletes.\nThe chart based on sex and body type in the article \u201cZone Meal Plans\u201d is perfect\nfor those who want to start the Zone Diet. If the athlete chooses the wrong block\nsize and does not obtain the desired results, the plan can be modified after a few\nweeks. Errors in block selection might slow progress, but initial errors are offset by\nthe huge value in starting a practice of weighing and measuring intake.\nSears details a more precise method to calculate one\u2019s block prescription in \u201cEnter\nthe Zone.\u201d It is:\nZone block prescription = lean body mass (lb.) x activity level (g/lb. of lean\nbody mass) / 7 (g protein/block)\nThe activity level ranges on a scale of 0-1. For those who work out several days a\nweek and do not have a labor-intensive job, the activity level should be 0.7 (most\nCrossFit athletes). By dividing 0.7 by 7 g in the equation, this simplifies to a Zone\nblock prescription that is 10 percent of his or her lean mass.\nThe activity factor should increase if the athlete does CrossFit two or more times a\nday, trains for another sport in addition to CrossFit, or holds a strenuous daily job\n(e.g., construction, farming, etc., and potentially coaching, if on one\u2019s feet all day).\nAlthough CrossFit workouts are relatively intense, they are not long in duration.\nAn individual does not need to increase the activity level value based on intensity\nalone; activity volume determines activity factor.\nSAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE ZONE BLOCK PRESCRIPTION\nSuppose an athlete is 185 lb. (84 kg) with 16 percent body fat. He does CrossFit five\ndays per week and works in a typical office environment. A sample calculation of"}
{"68": "TABLE 1. MACRONUTRIENT AND CALORIE COMPOSITION\nFOR 15 BLOCKS A DAY\nProtein 15 blocks x 7 g = 105 g (420 calories)\nCarbohydrate 15 blocks x 9 g = 135 g (540 calories)\nFat 15 blocks x 3 g = 45 g (405 calories)\nTotal Calories = 1,365\nNote the total calories presented here are underestimated due to hidden calories.\nMost foods are classified by a single macronutrient, despite the presence of some\nother macronutrients (e.g., nuts are classified as a fat but have some protein and\ncarbohydrate calories). These less predominant macronutrients for each source\nare not included in the total calorie calculations.\nThis athlete could also choose to round up to 16 blocks, particularly if he or she is\nmore likely to have compliance issues. The Zone prescription is a calorie-restrictive\ndiet and can be especially difficult for new adopters. When one\u2019s calculation has a\ndecimal value, rounding up to the next whole block might result in slower progress\nbut produce better long-term compliance. Once the athlete has become accus-\ntomed to the diet, then the total blocks can be rounded down to 15, particularly if\ndesired body composition has not been achieved.\nINCREASING FAT INTAKE\nThe caloric restriction leans out the athlete while providing enough protein and\ncarbohydrate for typical CrossFit activity levels. However, the athlete can become\ntoo lean. The athlete is considered \u201ctoo lean\u201d when performance decreases in\ncombination with continued weight loss. \u201cToo lean\u201d should not be based on body\nweight or appearance alone. When a loss of mass coincides with a drop in perfor-\nmance, the athlete needs to add calories to the diet. This can be accomplished by\ndoubling the fat intake (Table 2)."}

{"70": "SUPPLEMENTATION\nWhole, unprocessed foods are the best source of both macronutrients and micro-\nnutrients in terms of composition, variety, and density, such that supplementation\nis generally not recommended. We contend that eating a diet composed of known\nquantities and of high-quality whole foods is the most important aspect of nutri-\ntion for improved performance and health. Not only are supplements generally\npoorer nutrient sources, but they are also an unnecessary focus for someone not\nfollowing our basic diet plan of weighed and measured meat and vegetables, etc.\nHowever, we find one supplement beneficial enough to make a blanket recom-\nmendation: fish oil. Fish oil provides omega-3 fatty acids, which are a type of poly-\nunsaturated fat.\nPhysiological fats are known as triglycerides in biological terms; they are composed\nof a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached (Figure 1). The attached fatty\nacids are mixtures of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats. Al-\nthough one fatty acid is prominent in each food, all three are represented to some\ndegree. Figure 2 provides a summary of the types of fat and example food sources.\nThe two types of polyunsaturated fats found most frequently in foods are ome-\nga-3 and omega-6 fats. Classifying a fatty acid as omega-3 versus omega-6 is\ndependent on chemical structure. Polyunsaturated fats are sources of the two\nessential fatty acids, meaning they must be obtained from the diet. They are al-\npha-linolenic acid (ALA) (an omega-3) and linoleic acid (LA) (an omega-6). Ome-\nga-3 fats are known as \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d fats, and omega-6 fats are known as\n\u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d fats based on their physiological functions. Both are needed\nin relatively equal quantities."}
{"71": "Figure 2. Summary of Fatty Acids and Example Food Sources."}
{"72": "Fish-oil supplementation improves the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids\nand reduces the inflammatory responses in the body. Fish oil provides two types\nof omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid\n(DHA), the form of omega-3 fats preferred by the brain and body. The body can\nconvert ALA to EPA and DHA, but the conversion process is inefficient. Some prac-\ntitioners have recommended a combined daily intake on the order of 3 grams of\nEPA and DHA for an otherwise healthy individual, although the exact amount is\ndictated by one\u2019s total omega-6 intake. Each brand of fish oil has a different con-\ncentration of EPA and DHA per serving as indicated on the label. Individuals might\nhave to take multiple servings to get 3 grams of EPA and DHA, as brands might\ninclude omega-3s that are neither EPA nor DHA (e.g., ALA). Flax seed or oil is not an\nappropriate supplement for omega-3s. Flax is a good source of ALA, but because\nof the poor conversion to EPA and DHA, it is not recommended. If the individual is\nvegan, DHA can be obtained with algae oil.\nResearch has indicated positive health benefits by supplementing with fish oil.\nOmega-3 fats help increase the fluidity of cell membranes, and research has in-\ndicated supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular function,\nnervous-system function, immune health, memory, and mood issues. Omega 3s\nalso function as an anti-coagulant, so military personnel should consider remov-\ning fish oil supplements from their diet a couple of weeks prior to deployment.\nIt might also be appropriate for those with an upcoming surgery to stop taking\nfish oil two weeks from that date. These individuals should talk with their doctor\nregarding these circumstances.\nIt is possible to avoid omega-3 supplementation depending on food intake, al-\nthough the individual needs to be fastidious with his or her diet. This could be\naccomplished by avoidance of all vegetable oils (which are used at most every\nrestaurant), and nuts and seeds. Meat would have to be grass-fed and eggs pas-\nture-raised, and wild-caught fish should be consumed a few times a week. Be-\ncause this is not practical for many people, supplementation is effective.\nBesides the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3s in the diet, the total amount of poly-"}

There are other factors that\nwill ultimately overshadow any disadvantages inherent in the potentially less ef-\nfective regimen, such as convenience, attitude, exercise selection, and pacing.\nFor the remainder of this article the three-day cycle is the one in discussion, but\nmost of the analysis and discussion applies perfectly to the five-day cycle.\nELEMENTS BY MODALITY\nLooking at the Template Macro View (Table 1) it can readily be seen that the tem-\nplate is based on the rotation of three distinct modalities: monostructural meta-\nbolic conditioning (M), gymnastics (G), and weightlifting (W). The monostructural\nmetabolic conditioning activities are commonly referred to as \u201ccardio,\u201d the pur-\npose of which is primarily to improve cardiorespiratory capacity and stamina.\nThey are repetitive, cyclical movements that could be sustained for long periods\nof time. The gymnastics modality comprises body-weight exercises/elements or\ncalisthenics, and its primary purpose is to improve body control by improving\nneurological components such as coordination, balance, agility, and accuracy, and\nto improve functional upper-body capacity and trunk strength. The weightlifting\nmodality comprises the most important weight-training basics, Olympic lifts and\npowerlifting, where the aim is primarily to increase strength, power, and hip/leg\ncapacity. This category includes any exercise with the addition of an external load.\nTable 2 gives the common exercises used by our program, separated by modality,\nin fleshing out the routines.\nFor metabolic conditioning the exercises are run, bike, row, and jump rope. The\ngymnastics modality includes air squats, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, handstand\npush-ups, rope climbs, muscle-ups, presses to handstands, back/hip extensions,\nsit-ups, and jumps (vertical, box, broad, etc.). The weightlifting modality includes\nTABLE 2. EXERCISES BY MODALITY"}
{"76": "deadlifts, cleans, presses, snatches, clean and jerks, medicine-ball drills and\nthrows, and kettlebell swings.\nThe elements, or exercises, chosen for each modality were selected for their\nfunctionality, neuroendocrine response, and overall capacity to dramatically and\nbroadly impact the human body.\nWORKOUT STRUCTURE\nThe workout structure varies by the inclusion of one, two, or three modalities for\neach day (Table 3). Days 1, 5, and 9 are each single-modality workouts whereas days\n2, 6, and 10 include two modalities each (couplets), and finally, days 3, 7, and 11 use\nthree modalities each (triplets). In every case each modality is represented by a\nsingle exercise or element; i.e., each M, W, and G represents a single exercise from\nmetabolic conditioning, weightlifting, and gymnastics modalities respectively.\nWhen the workout includes a single exercise (days 1, 5, and 9) the focus is on a\nsingle exercise or effort. When the element is the single \u201cM\u201d (day 1) the workout is\na single effort and is typically a long, slow, distance effort. When the modality is a\nsingle \u201cG\u201d (day 5) the workout is practice of a single skill, and typically this skill is\nsufficiently complex to require great practice but might not be yet suitable for in-\nclusion in a timed workout because performance is not yet adequate for efficient\ninclusion. When the modality is the single \u201cW\u201d (day 9) the workout is a single lift and\ntypically performed at high weight and low repetition. It is worth repeating that the\nfocus on days 1, 5, and 9 is single efforts of \u201ccardio\u201d at long distance; improving\nhigh-skill, more complex gymnastics movements; and single/low-rep heavy\nweightlifting basics, respectively. This is not the day to work sprints, pull-ups, or\nhigh-repetition clean and jerks \u2014the other days would be more appropriate.\nTABLE 3.

{"79": "SCALING CROSSFIT\nCrossFit workouts, and especially those on CrossFit.com, are designed to chal-\nlenge even the most advanced athlete. Many athletes need to \u201cscale\u201d (i.e., modify)\nthe workouts for the safest implementation of the program. Finding a CrossFit\naffiliate is one way to receive proper coaching and guidance through this pro-\ncess. In absence of an experienced trainer, this article presents some basic\nconcepts for scaling workouts particularly for beginners. Scaling for other pop-\nulations (e.g., advanced or injured athletes) is discussed in greater detail at the\nLevel 2 Certificate Course, as well as in the Online Scaling Course.\nAthletes will need to scale workouts for variable lengths of time. One\u2019s athletic\nbackground, as well as his or her current health and fitness capacity, dictates how\nlong scaling is necessary. The methodology presented here can be used indefi-\nnitely, but a month is the minimum period for which significant scaling should be\napplied. This introductory period serves two purposes: 1) it develops competency\nof movements used in CrossFit; and 2) it appropriately exposes the athlete to grad-\nual increases in intensity and volume.\nMECHANICS AND CONSISTENCY FIRST\nCrossFit\u2019s charter for creating the most optimal balance of safety, efficacy, and\nefficiency is: mechanics, consistency, then\u2014and only then\u2014intensity. The initial\nexposure to CrossFit is when movement mechanics should be prioritized over in-\ntensity. And for some, just practicing the movements will be intense. It is impera-\ntive that the movements can be performed correctly and consistently before load\nand speed are added. While intensity is an important part of the CrossFit program,\nit is added after movement proficiency is established. Ignoring this order increas-\nes the risk for injury and potentially blunts long-term progress, especially if poor\nmechanics are combined with load.\nSCALING EFFECTIVELY: PRESERVE THE STIMULUS\nWhen scaling workouts, the main principle to follow is \u201cpreserve the stimulus.\u201d"}
{"80": "Intensity and Volume\nTwo factors need to be scaled for every beginner: 1) intensity; and 2) volume. A\nprudent method for beginners is reducing intensity and/or volume by half for at\nleast two weeks. Depending on how the athlete progresses, volume and intensity\ncan be gradually increased in the following weeks, months, and years.\nIntensity refers to the amount of power an athlete generates. Intensity may be\nmodified in three ways: 1) load; 2) speed; and/or 3) volume.\nLoad is the variable to scale first; scaling the load is an easy way to preserve the\nstimulus relative to an athlete\u2019s capacity. Load is also the most common variable\nmodified after the beginner period. Especially for a conditioning workout, the ath-\nlete should use a load that ensures he or she is able to complete the first set or\nround without compromising form or reaching muscular failure. Determining ap-\npropriate loads for newer athletes requires some estimation, and scaling will not\nalways be perfect. Often, loads for newer athletes will be less than 50 percent\nof the prescribed load, especially if an athlete is new to lifting weights. Coaches\nshould err on the side of scaling too much rather than not enough, particularly for\nnewer athletes.\nSpeed tends to be more self-modulated due to the athlete\u2019s fitness level, although\na coach can modulate speed based on the mechanics demonstrated. A coach\nmight have to slow an athlete down to achieve the correct mechanics. Similarly,\ncoaches might have to encourage an athlete who is moving well to move faster,\nthough this is less common when working with beginners (see \u201cTechnique\u201d article).\nVolume is the total amount of work accomplished by the athlete. Depending on\nthe workout, volume can be lowered by reducing: 1) time; 2) reps/rounds; and/or\n3) distance.\nNewer CrossFit athletes might attempt to struggle through a workout where\nthe volume of repetitions (or load, above) is beyond their current capacity. For\nexample, an advanced CrossFit athlete might complete Fran in 2 minutes. That"}
{"81": "Movements\nWhen a movement cannot be performed at all, it can be substituted. CrossFit\nsuggests modifying this variable last because avoiding a movement prevents an\nindividual from developing proficiency in it. An athlete or trainer should first try re-\nducing the load before substituting the movement. If the workout calls for snatch-\nes at 95 lb., for example, it is generally preferable that the athlete performs the\nsnatches with a PVC pipe instead of substituting 95-lb. overhead squats.\nComplete movement substitutions should be considered when a physical limita-\ntion or injury is present, or when the load cannot be reduced. When selecting a\nsubstitute movement, trainers should try to preserve the original movement\u2019s\nfunction and range of motion as best they can. When determining movement sub-\nstitutions consider:\n1) Whether the movement is primarily driven by the lower body or\nupper body.\n2) The movement function (e.g., push versus pull).\n3) The range of motion used by the movement (specifically of the hips,\nknees, and ankles).\n4) The plane of movement.\nParticularly in the case of injury, a complete movement replacement might be nec-\nessary. Consideration of these variables can help trainers select a movement sub-\nstitution or replacement that is as similar as possible to the prescribed movement.\nA SAMPLE WEEK OF SCALING\nThis section outlines five typical CrossFit workouts. For each Workout of the Day\n(WOD), scaled workouts are presented with modifications to volume, load, and\nmovements. Some of the rationale for the options is also described. These scaled\nworkouts should be considered but three examples of the many options available.\nThey do not take the place of scaled workouts created by an experienced trainer\nwho is relying on intuition and detailed knowledge of a specific athlete."}

For\nexample, a 1-repetition-maximum snatch day may be changed to 3 repetitions.\nIn rare cases, the range of motion may be shortened until the mechanics are correct.

A medicine ball is\nparticularly useful for the newer athlete.\nThe muscle-up will need to be scaled, and this is best accomplished with upper-body pulling and\npushing movements, or even a banded version of the full movement itself.\nChanging the rep scheme can be useful when the modification significantly challenges the\nindividual\u2019s strength stamina. Doing so will allow the individual to achieve almost the same volume\nwhile he or she develops new skills and/or is exposed to heavier elements.\nCONCLUSION\nAthletes and their trainers should focus on movement proficiency before adding\nspeed and load. Workouts should be scaled significantly for at least a month, par-\nticularly with regard to intensity and volume. The period of scaling workouts\u2014\nespecially load\u2014might continue for months and years as the athlete develops\nthe requisite capacities.

{"108": "THE AIR SQUAT\nAll our athletes begin their squatting with the \u201cair squat\u201d; that is, without any\nweight other than body weight. As a matter of terminology, when we refer to the\n\u201csquat\u201d we are talking about an unladen, body-weight-only squat. When we wish\nto refer to a weighted squat we will use the term back squat, overhead squat, or\nfront squat, referring to those distinct weighted squats. Training with the front,\nback, and overhead squats before the weightless variant has been mastered re-\ntards athletic potential and compromises safety and efficacy.\nWhen has the squat been mastered? This is a good question. It is fair to say that\nthe squat is mastered when both technique and performance are superior. This\nsuggests that none of the points of performance are deficient and fast multiple\nreps are possible. Our favorite standard for fast multiple reps would be the Ta-\nbata squat (20 seconds on/10 seconds off repeated 8 times) with the weakest of\neight intervals being between 18 and 20 reps. Do not misunderstand \u2014we are\nlooking for 18-20 perfect squats in 20 seconds, rest for 10, and repeat seven\nmore times for a total of eight intervals.\nThe most common faults to look for are surrendering of the lumbar curve at the\nbottom, not breaking the parallel plane with the hips, slouching in the chest and\nshoulders, lifting the heels, and not fully extending the hip at the top (Figure 1).\nDo not even think about weighted squats until none of these faults belong to you.\nA relatively small angle of hip extension, while indicative of a beginner\u2019s or weak\nsquat and caused by weak hips extensors, is not strictly considered a fault as\nlong as the lumbar spine is neutral.\nCAUSES OF A BAD SQUAT\n1) Weak glute/hamstring. The glutes and hams are responsible for powerful\nhip extension, which is the key to the athletic performance universe.\n2) Poor engagement, weak control, and no awareness of glute and\nhamstring. The road to powerful, effective hip extension is a three-to-\nfive-year odyssey for most athletes."}

Additionally, the ad-\nvanced elements of the progression, the push press and jerk, train for and devel-\nop power and speed. Power and speed are \u201cking\u201d in sport performance.

{"124": "SUMMARY\nFrom shoulder press to push jerk the movements become increasingly more ath-\nletic, functional, and suited to heavier loads. The progression also increasingly\nrelies on the power zone. In the shoulder press, the power zone is used for stabi-\nlization only. In the push press the power zone provides not only stability but also\nthe primary impetus in both the dip and drive. In the push jerk the power zone is\ncalled on for the dip, drive, second dip, and squat. The role of the hip is increased\nin each exercise.\nWith the push press you will be able to drive overhead as much as 30 percent more\nweight than with the shoulder press. The push jerk will allow you to drive as much\nas 30 percent more overhead than you would with the push press.\nIn effect the hip is increasingly recruited through the progression of lifts to assist\nthe arms and shoulders in raising loads overhead. After mastering the push jerk\nyou will find that it will unconsciously displace the push press as your method of\nchoice when going overhead.\nThe second dip on the push jerk will become lower and lower as you both master\nthe technique and increase the load. At some point in your development, the loads\nwill become so substantial that the upper body cannot contribute but a fraction\nto the movement, at which point the catch becomes very low and an increasing\namount of the lift is accomplished by the overhead squat.\nOn both the push press and jerk, the \u201cdip\u201d is critical to the entire movement. The\nstomach is held very tightly and the resultant turnaround from dip to drive is sud-\nden, explosive, and violent.\nTRY THESE\n1) Start with 95 lb. and push press or push jerk 15 straight repetitions, rest\n30 seconds, and repeat for total of 5 sets of 15 repetitions each. Go up\nin weight only when you can complete all 5 sets with only 30 seconds of\nrest between each and do not pause in any set."}

{"133": "THE GLUTE-HAM DEVELOPER (GHD)\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s March 18, 2007, L1 lecture in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nOur definition of core strength is midline stabilization. In profile, there is a ref-\nerence line that trisects the spine and bisects the pelvis. Midline stabilization is\nthe ability to maintain rigidity, stability, and a lack of deflection about that line\n(Figure 1). This translates to improved efficiency and performance and greater\npower output.\nIt is critical to the deadlift, to the laden squat, to the shoulder press, and to any\nsport. In a swimmer\u2019s stroke\u2014when the left leg kicks and right arm pulls\u2014if the\ntorso deviates to one side, you lose energy. Energy is lost in its deflection, wheth-\ner throwing a punch, riding a bicycle, or squatting. The abdominals, with the hip\nflexors, control one side of the torso, with the hip extensors and erectors involved\non the other side.\nHowever, what we have in modern physical culture is an excessive awareness\nand focus on the anterior and not on the posterior. As a culture of athletes and\nnon-athletes alike, we are unfortunately frontally fixated. Pecs\u2014what about the\nrhomboids? Abs\u2014what about the erectors? Quads\u2014what about the glute-ham-\nstring? And for the best of functional movement\u2014punch, jump, throw, run\u2014the\nimpetus comes out of the posterior.\nWe see communities where there is a very deliberate and concerted effort to min-\nimize hip-flexor involvement in exercise. And yet, by insertion and origin, by me-\nchanical position and advantage, and just kinematically, the hip flexors, have\nseveral times the contraction capacity that is estimated of the abdominals. All of it:\nhip extensors, hip flexors, trunk flexors, and ex-\ntensors are essential to midline stabilization. The\nabdominals are just one part of the story.\nFor core strength (midline stabilization), we are"}

There is no trunk-extension work, no hip-extension\nwork, and hip flexion is deliberately limited. Some of these communities also have\nproblems with chronic back injury, which comes at no surprise. If there is anything\nto \u201cmuscle balance,\u201d it makes sense. In how many communities are they doing an\nequal number of deadlifts and squats to their sit-ups? Most of the military/law-en-\nforcement PT is completely devoid of full-range-of-motion hip extension. Rucking,\nrunning, jumping jacks\u2014all will not do it. The run, pull-up, sit-up, push-up, lath-\ner-rinse-repeat PT has no real good core movement. The crunch does not count.\nWhile a cumbersome and space-taking piece of gear, the GHD has been essential\nto our work. We have four of them in 2,500 square feet, so one every 600 feet.\nWe use the GHD for four exercises to heighten awareness and develop capacity\nat midline stabilization. The punchline to the story is that static contractions that\nstabilize the midsection are the most important and functional (powerful) muscu-\nlar contractions in that region. Static contractions for midline stabilization are the\nbest ab exercises known. No amount of crunches are ever going to get you to the\nsame end point as the L-sit, overhead squat, deadlift, etc.\nWhat we suspect is that if you could sequentially fire the abs with the same force\nin any kind of dynamic pattern, you would have the ability to seriously injure your\nspine. If you could ever crunch with the same force that you can stabilize, you\nwould be able to break your back at will. We have come hardwired unable to do\nthat\u2014that is my guess.\nThe movements are presented in the order in which they should be developed in\na client. The first thing is a simple hip extension: articulate at the hip only, maintain-\ning the distance from xiphoid process to pubic bone. There is no shortening of the\ntrunk. There is no trunk flexion,\njust hip extension and flexion\nwhile maintaining midline sta-\nbilization. The erectors are be-\ning used statically, and the"}

Then the back extends sequentially along the spine from \u201csouth\nto north\u201d (Figure 5).\nThis movement does a lot for a coach. It heightens a neurological awareness. It\nallows me to introduce some essential vernacular to the client. If we do not have\ncues that allow me to talk about hip flexion, trunk flexion, hip extension, trunk ex-\ntension, I am fairly worthless with a client. Very early, get clients to know terms. Be\nable to call it out and get the response you need.\nThis movement demonstrates tremendous control. There is hip flexion, hip ex-\ntension, trunk flexion and trunk extension in a combo \u201csnake\u201d move. Using those\nmuscles is essential for midline stabilization and working the posterior.\nThe fourth movement on the GHD is a sit-up but involves no trunk flexion. For the\nGHD sit-up, the pad is set so that the pelvis is free, and the athlete descends back\nto touch the ground and then comes back to seated. More than a few exercise\nphysiologists and certified trainers have observed that this movement is pure hip\nflexion and consequently asserted \u201cthere\u2019s no abs in that.\u201d\nBut what the abs are doing in this exercise is midline stabilization.\nBefore having clients perform the GHD sit-up, ensure they have demonstrated ca-\npacity in the hip extension, back extension, and hip-and-back extension. Even still,\ntheir first GHD sit-ups should be performed in a shortened range of motion, with\nthe trainer spotting behind them (Figure 6). That might be it for the first dose. Once\nthey come back and you can determine the effect from that dose, increase the\nrange of motion and volume as their capacity allows.\nTo perform a GHD sit-up, there is some leg flexion in the descent. Then, the leg\nextends dramatically and pulls the athlete to seated (Figure 7). Conversely, if the\nathlete does not extend the leg to come to seated, the primary movers are the hip"}
{"142": "The force with which an athlete comes up is amazing. Rather than being pulled\nfrom the psoas alone, which is a fairly dysfunctional kind of pull, the athlete uses\nthe full complement of hip-flexor musculature. Any time you are using a fraction of\nthe primary movers responsible for that articulation, it is not natural, not function-\nal, and contrary to nature. Not extending the leg can also be a little irritating to the\nlow back due to this shearing force on the lumbar spine. Performed correctly, the\nmovement is not irritating to the low back. Straightening that leg enables profound\nmusculature to lift from the pelvis.\nThere are people who have this irritation in the spine from a shear force. If you can\nteach them to extend the legs to work the full complement of hip flexors, we will\nmove the margins where this irritation occurs from 3 reps to 4 reps to 10 reps and\nso on. That is rehabilitation. That is neuromuscular re-education.\nThere is an adjunct movement to GHD sit-up in which the athlete is dynamic in the\ntrunk and static in the hip. It is the AbMat sit-up, where we deliberately take the\nhip flexors out of the equation and work the torso dynamically. The hip flexors are\nworking statically or possibly to no significant degree.\nTo do this, the hip flexors need to be removed from the line of action. The fat part\nof the AbMat goes toward the glutes, and the athlete puts the bottom of his or her\nsoles together with the knees butterflied. This positioning makes the hip flexors\ntangential to the line of action; i.e., they cannot do any productive work. This is\ndone deliberately. Then the athlete slowly and under control comes to seated by\ncontracting the abdominals. This is a very dynamic bit of trunk flexion and the hip\nflexors are removed (Figure 8).\nAs the athlete fails, adduct and extend the legs to some degree. This creates more\npurchase for the hip flexors and brings them into the line of action. This allows the\nathlete to modulate the assistance and keep each rep focused on the midsection.\nIf reps are performed slowly and deliberately, most athletes will fail a sit-up with-\nout an AbMat. The failure is not necessarily a neuromuscular failure. It is not"}

But that lum-\nbar region is fairly inflexible, and all that range of motion that is available moves\none from spinally extended through to neutral. There is no more shortening or\nflexion to it; it is not enough to sit up.\nWithout the AbMat, the sit-up is a biphasic movement. While I have solid contact,\nI use upper rectus and create enough momentum to throw the load to the hip\nflexors, where I have more connection. This means that the full rectus has little\nstimulus\u2014it is pulling me from spinally extended through to neutral, but absent\nof any load. The upper rectus is worked where there is a fulcrum, so the back flat-\ntens, but it is the hip flexors that pull me to seated. There is no amount of sit-ups\nyou can do on the ground that is ever going to work you from pubic bone to about\n3 or 4 inches above the belly button. The AbMat moves the athlete from spinally\nextended through to neutral in the lumbar spine against a load.\nHow big would your bench press get if you only pushed air? You would get as\nstrong as your abs will with a ground-based sit-up. With or without the pad, there\nis the same contraction and range of motion in the midsection. Without the pad,\nthe fibers shortened but there was no load and no real work completed. With the\npad, they got the same motion but under a load, and it produced fruitful work.\nThe two sit-ups, GHD and AbMat, complement each other beautifully. One is dy-\nnamic in the hips and static in the trunk; the other is dynamic in the trunk and stat-\nic in the hip. In conjunction with the L-sit (static in the trunk and hip), they develop\na formidable capacity in the midline."}

Rhabdo-\nmyolysis (often simply referred to as \u201crhabdo\u201d) is a medical condition that might\narise from breakdown of muscle tissue and release of the muscle cells\u2019 contents\ninto the bloodstream. This process can damage the kidneys and can lead to renal\nfailure or death in rare cases. Rhabdo is diagnosed when a patient with an appro-\npriate history has an elevated level of creatine kinase, also known as CK or CPK.\nCPK is easier to measure in the blood than myoglobin and is generally used as a\nmarker for rhabdo, even though it is the myoglobin that does the damage.\nTreatment consists of generous amounts of intravenous (IV) fluids to dilute and\nflush the myoglobin through the kidneys. In the worst cases, patients might need\ndialysis while the kidneys recover. Death, though rare, can result when kidney fail-\nure causes imbalances in the usual electrolytes, which can cause cardiac arrhyth-\nmias. Most patients make a complete recovery after being rehydrated with IV fluids\nover anywhere from several hours to a week or so, depending on the severity.\nThere are a few ways a CrossFit trainer can protect athletes from rhabdomyolysis:\n\u2022 Follow the charter of mechanics, consistency, intensity.\n\u2022 Know the movements that have a higher rate of rhabdomyolysis incidence\n(those that prolong the eccentric contraction), and be mindful of the total"}
{"154": "focus on using modest loads, reducing volume and coaching the athlete on tech-\nnique. At affiliates where there are \u201celements\u201d or \u201con-ramp\u201d classes that last a\ncouple of weeks, athletes should still be heavily scaled beyond this introductory\nperiod to ensure adequate time to acclimate to CrossFit training. If there are no\nseparate classes for beginners, treat the workouts as technique sessions for new-\ner athletes\u2013focus on their mechanics rather than speed or load. There is no set\nprotocol for how quickly to increase intensity, but it is wise to err on the side of\ncaution and work toward long-term fitness. Multiple months at scaled loads and\nvolumes are well within a normal timeframe for even the best athletes, with gradu-\nal increases in intensity implemented after that. Trainers need to frequently check\nin with athletes to determine how the previous dose of exercise affected them.\nAlthough intensity is a significant part of CrossFit, each athlete has his or her entire\nlife to continue to improve fitness and tolerance for intensity.\nThe second way to mitigate the risk of rhabdomyolysis is to know the movements\nassociated with a higher rate of incidence. Beginner athletes should keep \u201cnega-\ntives\u201d (movements which prolong the eccentric phase) to a minimum. Although\nnegatives can be an effective way to increase strength, they should not be used\nin high volumes with beginners. Athletes may increase the volume of negatives\ngradually over time.\nWhile the eccentric phase of movements cannot and should not be avoided, there\nare movements in which people are more likely to prolong the eccentric phase. In\nCrossFit, these tend to be jumping pull-ups and full-range-of-motion glute-ham de-\nveloper (GHD) sit-ups. In the jumping pull-up, the athlete should not prolong the\ndescent but should instead immediately drop to an extended-arm position once\nthe chin has cleared the bar, absorbing the impact with the legs. Similarly, in the\nfull-range-of-motion GHD sit-up, newer athletes should use fewer repetitions and\npotentially a shortened range of motion until capacity is developed. It is also prudent\nfor trainers to scale the number of repetitions and the range of motion for athletes\nwho do not routinely use GHD sit-ups regardless of their CrossFit experience. There\nare no exact rules for total volume, but beginners and new CrossFit athletes (and\neven advanced CrossFit athletes who have not been routinely using the GHD) should"}

Certain medications, in-\ncluding statins (cholesterol-lowering agents), increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis.\nSymptoms of rhabdomyolysis include severe generalized muscle pain, nausea\nand vomiting, abdominal cramping, and, in severe cases, dark-red or cola-colored\nurine. The discoloration of the urine comes from the muscle\u2019s myoglobin, which is\nthe same molecule that gives red meat its color. If these symptoms appear follow-\ning a workout (or at any time with regard to dark-red urine), the athlete should seek\nmedical attention immediately.\nThe athletes at highest risk seem to be those with a reasonable baseline level of\nfitness obtained through some non-CrossFit training, those who are returning to\nCrossFit after a layoff, or even experienced CrossFit athletes who reach volume\nor intensity significantly outside their established \u201cnorm.\u201d These athletes have\nsufficient muscle mass and conditioning to create enough intensity to hurt them-\nselves. Generally, the most deconditioned seem to be at less risk (but not zero). It\nis suspected they do not have enough muscle mass or the capacity to generate\nhigh levels of intensity. This being said, trainers must properly scale and focus on\nmechanics with every client regardless of current capacity.\nMINIMIZE EQUIPMENT- AND SPOTTING-RELATED INJURIES\nBeyond following the charter of mechanics, consistency, and intensity, affiliate\nowners can further minimize risk of injury within their gym. Very real risks exist\nfrom equipment condition, use, and arrangement, as well as from improper spot-\nting of athletes during movements.\nEquipment condition refers both to installation and day-to-day maintenance. In-\nstallation often applies to building pull-up rigs, hanging gymnastics rings, assem-\nbling a GHD, among other things. Professional assistance should be used when an"}
{"156": "regularly for integrity. Trainers must repair, replace, and discontinue use of faulty\nequipment immediately.\nArrangement refers to the layout of equipment and athletes during a class or\nworkout. Each athlete needs enough space to perform the movements, with an\nadditional buffer to account for the errant-moving equipment, missed attempts,\nand safe passage of coaches or other athletes. Under no circumstances should a\ntrainer permit extra equipment like bars, plates, boxes, etc. to be left lying around\nthe workout area. This equipment might trip athletes or cause a ricochet if other\nequipment lands on it.\nIt is also imperative for a trainer to prepare for falls during dynamic movements. It is\npossible that an athlete might lose his or her grip during a kip (pull-up or muscle-up).\nTrainers might encourage athletes to wrap their thumbs around any bar in an ef-\nfort to provide additional feedback to the athlete. This is not foolproof, however,\nand can sometimes be even less secure, particularly for athletes with small hands.\nWhatever the hand position chosen, it does not replace the need for the athlete to\ndevelop body awareness of when to end the movement if his or her grip is compro-\nmised (wrapping thumbs is always recommended for barbell and ring movements\nto help provide better balance and control, especially in higher-risk scenarios such\nas a bench press or muscle-up). Boxes and racks should not be beneath, behind or\ndirectly in front of these athletes. Adjustable rings should be lowered to the appro-\npriate height. Where assistance boxes are necessary, they are best placed to the side\nof the working athlete (and not in another athlete\u2019s way) to leave a clear path should\nan athlete leave the apparatus prematurely. A suggestion for trainers trying to man-\nage these risks is to do a \u201cdry run\u201d of the workout before it begins: check the working\nspace for each athlete for each of the proposed movements. This can be as simple as\norganizing the class to rotate stations on the trainer\u2019s call and perform a quick walk-\nthrough to check spacing and arrangement. Trainers can then instruct participants\nto move to the same spot during the workout to ensure safety.\nAthletes also need instruction regarding how to bail safely from lifts and how to\nspot other athletes where appropriate. In most weightlifting movements, the ath-"}
{"157": "can be successful (e.g., handstands). The spotter may be to the rear of the athlete\nif the risk of getting hit is low (e.g., ring support, GHD sit-up), but often a position\nbeside the athlete is best (e.g., handstand).\nTrainers need to be sure equipment is cleaned regularly to reduce the chance of\ninfection, and proper disinfectants and sterilizers, with clean cloths, should be\nstaged near the gym floor to clean blood off bars immediately. A blood-spill clean-\nup procedure can be found in the CrossFit Journal archives.\nMONITORING ATHLETES FOR CONDITIONS THAT NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION\nAlthough a trainer is primarily there to instruct and improve athlete movements,\nhe or she needs to monitor the level of exertion during the workout and ensure\nathlete health is protected. As CrossFit workouts use relatively high intensity, ath-\nletes are working at their physical and psychological tolerances. It is possible for\nathletes to push too hard, and confounding environmental factors might exacer-\nbate certain situations.\nExtreme temperature fluctuations, especially heat, can be problematic. Trainers\nshould be ready in unseasonably hot and humid weather with sufficient water, and\nthey should watch for common signs of overexertion (e.g., dizziness). Hot weather\nalso increases the potential risk for rhabdomyolysis (although some cases have\noccurred in cold climates), and trainers should encourage athletes to stay hydrated\n(with the caveat that they should not be excessively hydrated. Current mainstream\nliterature suggests rates of 1.2 L/hour, which are actually too high and can lead to\noverhydration). In the event of a potential heat stroke following a workout (e.g.,\nathlete demonstrates an altered mental state), a trainer should remove excess\nclothing from the athlete and then douse him or her with cool water before med-\nical attention arrives.\nWeather aside, other conditions might need medical attention. Symptoms such\nas numbness or chronic pain in joints and muscles should be referred to medical\nprofessionals. Medical attention is immediately necessary for any non-respon-\nsive athlete."}
{"158": "We advise against rehydration strategies that encourage consumption of fluids to\nprevent loss of body-weight during activity. Dehydration during physical activity is\na normal physiological process, and the thirst mechanism is sufficient in regulating\nhydration and serum sodium concentration during exercise.\nDrinking beyond thirst in an attempt to prevent body-weight loss during exercise\noffers no benefit to health or performance. It also presents a serious risk of ex-\nercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), a potentially deadly dilution of the body\u2019s\nserum sodium concentration. EAH is caused by overconsumption of fluid and can\nbe viewed as an iatrogenic condition due to the prevailing belief that exercising\nathletes should drink \u201cas much fluid as tolerable\u201d during training.\n\u201cFluid\u201d that can contribute to EAH includes electrolyte-enhanced sports drinks.\nContrary to popular belief, these commercial beverages do not reduce risk of hy-\nponatremia. Because of flavoring and sugar content, these drinks might present\ngreater risk for overconsumption of fluid than water alone, increasing the risk of\npotentially deadly EAH in athletes.\nSPECIAL POPULATIONS\nAny potential athlete with a medical condition needs to be cleared by a physician for\nexercise before a trainer recommends a fitness regimen. A medical-history form can\nbe a useful tool for a trainer to assess any potential issues, although trainers are also\nencouraged to ask questions regarding medical status and be aware of common\nmedical conditions that need clearance (e.g., diabetes, prescription medications).\nCommon special populations include pregnant athletes, and a trainer should still\nrequest medical clearance and guidelines from the physician once the condition is\nknown. The CrossFit Journal archive contains many resources regarding scaling for\npregnant athletes, such as the article \u201cPregnancy: A Practical Guide for Scaling.\u201d A\ntrainer should be especially aware of reducing the risk of potential falls in workouts\n(e.g., box jumps, rope climbs) and be observant for complaints of calf pain or swell-\ning, which can be signs of more serious issues."}

{"250": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nFOUNDATIONS OF EFFECTIVE TRAINING\nWhereas the Level 1 Certificate Course provides an introduction to functional movements and CrossFit methodol-\nogy, the Level 2 Course is focused on improving a trainer\u2019s ability to coach others.\nA trainer\u2019s ability to coach others rests on capacity in six different areas:\n\u2022 Teaching\n\u2022 Seeing\n\u2022 Correcting\n\u2022 Group Management\n\u2022 Presence and Attitude\n\u2022 Demonstration\nThe depth and breadth of a trainer\u2019s capacity in each area affects not only whether clients become more fit but also\nthe degree to which the clients become more fit. Effectiveness can be assessed by asking whether clients optimize\nwork capacity across broad time and modal domains (i.e., whether a client becomes as fit and healthy as possible)\nA newer trainer may have only rudimentary capacity in each area and clients still will see results because of the\ninherent benefits of performing constantly varied functional movements at high intensity. An effective trainer, on\nthe other hand, has the ability to safeguard health and improve performance for a client beyond what he or she\ncould do alone.\nAlthough these areas can be described and defined independently (below), there is a natural overlap among them in\na real-time coaching environment. A deficiency in any one area can inhibit a trainer\u2019s success. Even a weakness in one\narea relative to the others blunts the trainer\u2019s overall reach. For example, a trainer with tremendous knowledge and\ntechnical skill (teaching, seeing, and correcting) will still have difficulty retaining members if there is little persona\nconnection with them (presence and attitude).\nRegardless of a trainer\u2019s current level of proficiency, a commitment to improving each area is the hallmark of a\nsuccessful trainer. Similar to the athlete\u2019s path to refining and improving movement mechanics, a trainer must refine\ncoaching skills across a career to become great. Doing so develops virtuosity in coaching.\nTEACHING\nThe ability to effectively articulate and instruct the mechanics of each movement, including the ability to focus on major\npoints of performance before more subtle or nuanced ones. It also includes the ability to change instruction based on\nthe athlete\u2019s needs and capacity.\nTo teach functional movements, a trainer must first understand what defines proper mechanics and what may cause\npoor movement. A trainer must know ideal positions, but more frequently a trainer\u2019s job is to teach athletes how to\nimprove poor positions and movement patterns.\nKnowledge in fitness-related areas\nBeyond movement mechanics, trainers can also instruct clients in other areas that may improve their fitness. Greater\nknowledge in any field that overlaps with fitness\u2014such as anatomy and physiology, nutrition, or even expertise in"}
{"251": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\na certain sport\u2014can aid a trainer\u2019s teaching. The more athletically advanced the athlete, the greater the depth of\nknowledge needed for a trainer to produce additional fitness gains. Continued research, education, and practical\nexperience over the course of a career develop a breadth of knowledge applicable to any athlete, from beginner to elite.\nTeaching demands not only possessing knowledge but also the ability to impart it to others. Knowledge alone does\nnot make one an effective teacher. Successful teaching hinges on a trainer\u2019s ability to accurately convey as much of\nthat knowledge as possible to others.\nEffective communication\nTo convey knowledge effectively, a teacher must be able to change his or her communication style to meet the\ncapacity of the student, regardless of his or her background, ability, and learning style. This is why trainers are\nbest served by using different means of communication\u2014visual and verbal teaching, for example\u2014to aid learning.\nImplicit in the trainer-athlete dialogue is the trainer taking responsibility for when communication with the athlete\nbreaks down. It is the trainer\u2019s responsibility to guide and lead the athlete, and it is the athlete\u2019s responsibility to be\ncommitted to the process. However, if the athlete is clearly frustrated with the instruction, the trainer must change\nstrategies or communication style until the athlete succeeds.\nA trainer can also assess the effectiveness of teaching and communication by determining whether the athlete meets\nperformance expectations. If no one in a group moves to the level the trainer expects, he or she needs to reevaluate\nthe instruction. It is often not the athlete\u2019s fault. A good teacher can use effective communication to prevent a large\npercentage of problems from occurring. For example, it is often effective to break complex movements down into\na progression or logical teaching steps that allow the athlete to practice pieces that naturally build on one another.\nA teacher who shows an athlete a barbell clean, describes it in its entirety, and then asks the class to replicate it can\nexpect few (if any) to match the instruction. Conversely, using a progression\u2014such as that demonstrated for the\nmedicine-ball clean at the Level 1 Course\u2014will get more athletes to demonstrate the gross mechanics quickly. These\nprogressions can often help a trainer focus on seeing certain faults as well.\nTeaching as much as is necessary often means the teacher must reduce and simplify his or her body of knowledge\nto the one or two most salient points at that moment for that particular athlete. With fast-paced human movement,\nchange is often hampered by long and detailed explanations when simple, broad-brush instructions are more digest-\nible. This does not mean a trainer\u2019s knowledge of the system should be simple; it is the explanation that should be.\nA trainer can ask himself or herself, \u201cWhat is the one thing this athlete needs right now?\u201d The answer will change as\nprogress is made.\nseeing\nThe ability to distinguish good from poor movement mechanics and identify both gross and subtle faults whether the\nathlete is in motion or static.\nA trainer who can effectively assess the mechanical positions as sound or unsound throughout movement has\ncapacity in seeing. Seeing is the necessary first step for a trainer to bring about change in a client\u2019s mechanics, but it\nrests on one\u2019s teaching capacity (knowledge). Trainers must first know positions of best mechanical leverage, as well\nas the effect of varying anthropometrics on these positions. If a trainer does not know what to look for, he or she will\nnot see correctible issues."}
{"252": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nStatic faults\nThe trainer must also use visual-recognition skills throughout the repetition, whether the athlete is static or dynamic\nStatic positions are the points at which the athlete is not moving, even briefly. Static positions usually occur near\nthe end ranges of motion\u2014either in the starting, receiving, or finishing positions\u2014or when there is a brief pause or\ndecreased speed, often due to a change of direction. Static positions include the setup position for a deadlift or the\nbottom of a squat, for example. Correctly identifying faults is easier in static positions because these positions give\ntrainers more time for assessment.\nDynamic faults\nDynamic positions find the athlete moving between the static positions, often at high speed. Examples of faults\nseen in dynamic movements include not reaching full hip extension in the drive phase of a clean, pressing early in a\npush press, or initiating the squat with the knees. These dynamic faults are more difficult to identify because of the\ndecreased time for assessment. The trainer must also know when and where to see faults during the movement. For\nexample, a trainer needs to see that the athlete has the weight on the heels during the drive phase of a push jerk\nbut the trainer is also evaluating the trunk-to-femur relationship for hip extension, the bar path relative to the fronta\nplane, and a whole host of other relationships. Generally, a profile view of the athlete (offset by about 45 degrees)\nis the most useful view to assess the athlete\u2019s mechanics, but trainers should not be limited to using this view only.\nThe difficulty in seeing dynamic faults increases as:\n1. the athlete moves more quickly, and\n2. the faults become more subtle.\nYears of experience help a trainer effectively coach any level of athlete. New trainers may use a few methods to\ndevelop their ability to see faults, particularly dynamic faults. One method is to study film. Slow the movement down\nto a series of static frames. A trainer may choose to film his or her own athletes or simply watch footage available\non the internet. Replaying the footage in real time after observing the movement in a static series can help bridge\nthe gap between seeing static and dynamic positions. Another strategy for newer trainers is to methodically survey\nathletes for only one fault at a time. For example, when teaching athletes the push jerk, the trainer may choose to\nwatch only for hip extension during the first several repetitions. Then, the trainer may choose to watch and see if\nthe athletes drive through their heels. Over time, trainers can observe multiple faults simultaneously (e.g., lack of hip\nextension or not having the weight on the heels), but initially, trying to see everything often results in seeing nothing\nSimilarly, newer trainers generally find more success by watching one athlete at a time per repetition instead of\nscanning multiple athletes with every repetition.\nCorreCTing\nThe ability to facilitate better mechanics for an athlete using visual, verbal, and/or tactile cues. This includes the ability\nto triage (prioritize) faults in order of importance, which requires an understanding of how multiple faults are related.\nThe ability of a trainer to facilitate improved mechanics is dependent on capacities in teaching and seeing. Teaching\nreflects a trainer\u2019s knowledge of proper mechanics; seeing reflects a trainer\u2019s ability to discern these positions in rea\ntime. If capacity is limited in either, it follows that the trainer\u2019s capacity in correcting will also be weak.\nCorrecting mechanics results in both increased performance gains and decreased risk of injury. A trainer can expect\nto correct an athlete\u2019s mechanics forever; mechanics can be infinitely refined to create ever more efficient positions"}

CrossFit trainers should strive for excellent mechanics in their clients and avoid settling for\n\u201cOK\u201d movement. This means a trainer must be able to correct both gross and subtle deviations in all levels of athletes\nThey must set a high standard for good movement and be relentless in the constant pursuit of improvement.\nCorrecting hinges on the trainer\u2019s ability to:\n1. use successful cues,\n2. know multiple corrections for each fault,\n3. triage faulty movement, and\n4. balance critique with praise.\nCues\nAny cue that results in improved movement mechanics is successful and therefore a good cue. There are no specific\nformulas, formats, or rules to follow for cues, and their value is based on the result. A cue\u2019s primary function is to\nhelp the athlete execute perfect mechanics, not to perfectly describe the mechanics of the movement. For example\none may say \u201cweight in heels\u201d to help a person shift weight back and better achieve pressure across the foot (versus\non the toes). Generally, making cues short, specific, and actionable tends to result in a greater success rate. Short\nspecific, and actionable cues are useful because the trainer gives a single task for the athlete to complete. An example\nof this type of cue is, \u201cPush your knees out.\u201d It is short (four words), specific to a body part (knees), and also indicates\naction and/or direction (out). It is easy for the athlete to respond to a cue such as this, even when performing a com-\nplicated movement.\nIt is possible for a trainer to confuse cueing with fault identification. For example, pointing out the fault that is pres-\nent\u2014\u201cYour knees are caving in\u201d\u2014does not tell the athlete how to fix it. An experienced athlete may be able to make\nthe leap from hearing the identification of the fault to then fixing it, but this translation from fault identification to\nspecific direction is ultimately the trainer\u2019s responsibility.\nTrainers may also rely on more technical language in their cues (i.e., \u201cYou are losing your midline\u201d), which assumes the\nathlete has a significant amount of fitness-related knowledge. While such language may give the appearance of being\nmore technical (and perhaps represents an attempt to sound more intelligent), it is at best a vague verbal cue. Cues\nshould be kept to simple language that is easily understood by anyone. Non-specific language is also best avoided\nin cues. Something such as, \u201cGet tight!\u201d or \u201cChest!\u201d can be meaningless to the athlete, especially in the absence of\ninstruction on how to \u201cget tight\u201d or where and how to move the chest.\nA basic three-step process for developing short, specific, and actionable cues is:\n1. identify the fault,\n2. identify what is out of place (be specific: name the body part), and\n3. give direction to that body part.\nAs stated before, \u201cPush your knees out\u201d is a short, specific, and actionable cue.\nHowever, even with short, specific, and actionable cues, there is no guarantee the athlete\u2019s movement will improve\nThe trainer needs to use multiple cues until the fault is resolved. There are cases in which a cue that is effective for\none athlete is ineffective for another, and in other cases, even a good cue may result in poor movement. \u201cGet your"}

Nevertheless, some athletes interpret this cue to mean that the weight should be on their heels exclusively\nand they fall backwards or lose their balance. That does not mean the cue was bad or the trainer was wrong; it means\nthe trainer has to try an alternative cue.\nA trainer should not be limited to a certain set of cues for a specific fault, and he or she should continue to use differ-\nent cues until the movement improves. Over time, a trainer develops corrective strategies, building a bank of options\nfor every fault. These corrective strategies should include verbal (i.e., speaking), visual (i.e., showing), and tactile\n(i.e., touching) cues, all of which may be employed to fix the same fault but may be interpreted differently among\nathletes. Verbal cues tell the athlete a specific instruction, visual cues create contrasting images between current and\npreferred positioning, and tactile cues use physical targets to achieve proper mechanics. The greater the number of\nstrategies a trainer can employ for any fault, the more likely it is that he or she will be successful in correcting the fault\nTriaging faults\nDetermining which single fault to correct can be a challenge, as multiple faults often occur together. Ideally, every\nfault would be addressed simultaneously, but this is unrealistic in practice. The trainer is best served by triaging\nfaults. The term \u201ctriaging\u201d is most often used in medicine to assign urgency to those needing medical attention\nTriaging when coaching movement means assigning urgency to the multiple faults present in order of the most to\nleast important. Greater importance is assigned to faults that have the highest risk for injury (and, therefore, also the\ngreatest potential to limit performance). In a loaded environment, there are many cases in which the fault to address\nfirst would be loss of a neutral spine, usually in flexion. However, a flexed lumbar curve at depth in an air squat is less\nconcerning than that same position in a loaded back squat. This athlete needs to continue to air squat to full depth\nfighting for a neutral midline, all while maintaining the range of motion required by life. It is precisely the practice of\nthe movement, even with less-than-ideal mechanics, that will eventually allow him or her to reclaim positions that\ncan be loaded. In this example, completing the full range of motion was given more priority than midline stabilization\nThe ordering is based on the severity of the deviation from the ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task\nthere is no single ordering of faults that can be used across all athletes in all applications.\nWhichever fault the trainer decides to fix first should become the trainer\u2019s focus. He or she has to selectively ignore\nthe other faults present. Once that fault is fixed or mitigated at least to the degree that it is no longer the most import-\nant, the trainer can move on to the next issue.\nAfter choosing which fault to address, the trainer needs to know how the various faults are related. A trainer may\ncue a different body part than the one he or she is trying to fix due to the interrelatedness of movement mechanics\nSuppose an athlete performs an air squat with the following faults: weight shifting forward, knees collapsing, and\nback rounding. The trainer needs to consider: Are the caving knees causing the back to round? Is the rounded back\ncausing the weight to shift forward? Perhaps the trainer chooses to address the back position first but actually tells\nthe athlete, \u201cPush the knees out.\u201d There are cases in which allowing more room for the pelvis helps create a neutra\nspine position.\nAssess the cue\u2019s effectiveness and provide feedback\nAfter a trainer delivers a cue, he or she must stay with that athlete for at least another repetition to assess the result\nWhatever the athlete\u2019s response, the trainer needs to provide feedback. A trainer needs to let the athlete know if\nthe movement was the same, better, or worse. If the movement improves, a trainer needs to acknowledge that"}
{"255": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nperhaps with, \u201cThat\u2019s better\u201d or, \u201cGood correction.\u201d This helps the athlete develop kinesthetic awareness of proper\npositioning. In some cases, an athlete may improve movement but not to the desired degree. Encouraging these\nathletes simply to give more in that same direction is often a sound strategy (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s better, but even lower!\u201d). If\nthe movement has not changed, this could be addressed simply by saying, \u201cNot there yet\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019ll come back to you,\u201d\nfor example. An unsuccessful cue should not be repeated multiple times with a single athlete; instead, the trainer\nshould find a new cue. If the movement changes for the worse, the trainer also needs to immediately recognize this\nand stop or reverse it (e.g., \u201cOther way\u201d).\nNot staying to assess the effectiveness of a cue and provide the athlete with feedback is almost the same as not\ngiving a cue at all. If a trainer tells an athlete to do something and walks away before seeing the result, he or she may\nmiss it when a cue results in no change or even change for the worse. The athlete has no idea if his or her efforts\nhave resulted in improvement. All feedback, positive and negative, is tied to the athlete developing better kinesthetic\nawareness. Precision of word choice is critical. The use of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d needs to be reserved for actual sound or\nimproved mechanics and not used as a filler.\nThroughout the cueing process, a trainer must also be aware when praise for hard work (regardless of change) is\nnecessary. There are cases where no change or only a very slight change occurs in a session. Celebrating the effort\nacknowledges the hard work put forth that day and helps a client remain willing to continue to work hard. A trainer\njust needs to be clear when the praise is for the effort rather than a movement that still needs improvement.\ngrouP ManageMenT\nThe ability to organize and manage, both at a micro level (within each class) and at the macro level (the gym as a\nwhole). This includes managing time well; organizing the space, equipment, and participants for optimal flow and\nexperience; planning ahead; etc.\nGroup management is not just about organizing logistical considerations for a class so clients have enough space\ntime, and equipment to complete the workout. It is about optimally managing these variables to support the best\npossible instruction (see \u201cComponents of an Effective Class\u201d). Poor planning of any aspect of a class\u2014for example\nthe amount of time spent on certain parts, how the equipment is set up, and how much time is allotted to each par-\nticipant\u2014can detract from the quality of the experience.\nAdhere to the schedule\nAt its most basic level, effective group management means adhering to posted schedules. Clients plan their sched-\nules around these announced times, and it should not be assumed that they have more time or flexibility. Adhering\nto posted times means both starting and ending on time: Running over is as unacceptable as starting late. Ending\nlate usually occurs when a trainer does not plan ahead and think through the entire class schedule. Adhering to the\nschedule also includes the schedule within each class. Following a simple template (such as introduction, warm-up\nworkout, and post-workout) every class helps ensure necessary time is devoted to each piece (see \u201cComponents of\nan Effective Class\u201d). The trainer may also consider the experience level of the class to determine which pieces need\nmore time or less time during instruction.\nSpace and equipment layout\nGroup management also includes variables such as space layout and equipment availability. The layout needs to\naccount for buffer zones around any equipment in use and should also take into account when athletes have to move"}

Even in cases in which neither is limited, an effective trainer should have pre-determined alter-\nnatives for any class workout should a larger number of participants show up unexpectedly.\nGroup management speaks to the trainer\u2019s ability to reduce the logistical setup and preparation time during a class to\nmaximize the amount of teaching and movement time. This means the trainer plans ahead and perhaps prearranges\na complicated workout with multiple pieces of equipment and/or weights. Spending several or more minutes sorting\nequipment takes away from a trainer\u2019s time to instruct, improve, and refine movement.\nPlan how and what to teach\nTime spent on instruction can also reduce the client\u2019s practice time. A trainer needs to plan how and what to teach to\nmaximize the client\u2019s time moving. Allowing for enough practice time every class is necessary for both the trainer and\nclient. Less practice time gives the trainer less time to observe and cue movement mechanics, as well as less time for\na client to work on movement with improved form. Change in mechanics comes from continual cueing across many\nrepetitions.\nDuring every class, the trainer also needs to manage the attention given to each participant. Every student should\nfeel that he or she received enough attention. While some clients need more time than others, even good movers\nwith subtle inefficiencies need to be coached, pushed for higher speed and/or loads, or praised for sound perfor-\nmance. Attention still benefits them. To assist with each client getting enough individual attention, a helpful tool is\nto keep the group on the trainer\u2019s cadence for all repetitions during the warm-up or skill work. Controlling when the\ngroup moves ensures the same number of repetitions are completed by everyone. It also allows the trainer to sys-\ntematically and selectively observe individuals and specific aspects of their movement.\nThe size of the class affects how much time a trainer can spend with each person, but the class size should not be\nbeyond the trainer\u2019s capacity. The demands of large classes often turn trainers into crowd herders, timekeepers and\ncheerleaders who have little time to spend on cueing individual movement faults. Newer trainers (those with less\nthan two years of experience) can rarely find success when stepping into classes of 10-plus participants. In his article\n\u201cScaling Professional Training,\u201d CrossFit Founder Greg Glassman explained that after years of one-on-one persona\ntraining produced groups of two, eventually groups of three, and so on, his classes continued to grow until growth\nresulted in \u201cperceived reduction in attention\u201d to each paying member.\nRegardless of experience, trainers should make an honest assessment of the time and attention given to each client\nafter each training session. Did he or she make an assessment of each athlete\u2019s weaknesses? Did he or she make rea\nmovement change that session? If the answer to either question is no, the session was likely too large for the trainer\nThe goal is to maximize a trainer\u2019s effectiveness and reach.\nPresenCe and aTTiTude\nThe ability to create a positive and engaging learning environment, showing empathy for athletes and creating rapport\n\u201cPresence and attitude\u201d refers to the trainer\u2019s ability to create a positive atmosphere and develop a rapport with each\nclient.

The trainer recognizes that individuals respond\ndifferently to instruction and critique and makes it his or her responsibility to determine how best to relate to and\nmotivate each individual regardless of background and ability.\nA trainer must be aware of whether each client is interested in each class; a client\u2019s needs may change with the days\nand external life demands. The trainer should know what is happening with most of the group most of the time, and\nthis goes beyond movement mechanics. This includes issues such as who is struggling that day due to external pres-\nsures or stress, who has high energy, who is aloof or annoyed, who is new to the gym, etc. All these factors may affect\nthe degree to which the athletes can perform relative to their usual capacity. Effective trainers know these things\nbecause they routinely interact with their clients and are invested in their relationships with them.\nA common trait of trainers with a positive presence and attitude is that they genuinely care about their clients\u2019 success\nThis care means more to clients than the trainer\u2019s knowledge. Many clients have little interest in the technical aspects\nof training. Their interests often lie in unrelated professions and hobbies, and they are at the gym to improve the\nquality of their lives. The mechanisms of their success in the gym are much less important to them than the results\nand success itself. In addition to seeing results, clients know if they feel welcomed and cared for, respected, inspired\nand motivated. They can sense whether the trainer has their best interests at heart.\nBe authentic\nA positive presence and attitude cannot be faked; it comes from a sincere passion for service. It can take on many\nforms based on the trainer\u2019s personality and interpersonal skills. Trainers should not interpret this as being any single\ntrait, such as loud, funny, or bubbly. Trainers are encouraged to be authentic. There is room for any personality type\nto succeed if a trainer couples genuine caring with awareness of his or her limitations and recognizes the effect he\nor she may have on clients. This may motivate a trainer to become a better version of himself or herself. A trainer\nmay set personal goals to compensate for any perceived shortcomings. For example, a trainer who is perceived as\nreserved may make an effort to be at class early to welcome and greet each member.\nNewer trainers especially may be shy or nervous in front of a group, and this may blunt their presence and attitude\nSmall mechanical changes, such as eye contact, open body language, and smiling, can go a long way toward putting\nthe trainer\u2019s best foot forward.

Just like teaching, demonstration may have to be made more simple and obvious\nthan realistic and subtle to meet the needs of the trainees. In cases in which a trainer\u2019s mechanics are limited, using\nothers for demonstration is perfectly acceptable.

{"261": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nCOMMON MOVEMENT THEMES FOR FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS\ninTroduCTion\nThere are common movement themes displayed in all foundational movements, from the nine foundational move-\nments in the Level 1 Course to others such as the snatch, kipping pull-up, and handstand push-up. These movement\nthemes broadly categorize similar positions and movement patterns, whether the athlete is static (starting, receiving\nor finishing positions) or dynamic (moving between static positions).\nThese themes are:\n\u2022 midline stabilization,\n\u2022 core-to-extremity movement,\n\u2022 balance about the frontal plane,\n\u2022 posterior-chain engagement,\n\u2022 sound hip function,\n\u2022 active shoulders,\n\u2022 full range of motion about a joint, and\n\u2022 effective stance and/or grip.\nUnderstanding these themes and the contexts in which to apply them will give trainers the general principles for eval-\nuating movement. There are positions or movement patterns that do not fit neatly into these categories, as well as\nmovements that do not demonstrate all the themes. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. It is simply a classification\ntool that can be used to aid development of one\u2019s coaching skill set.\nThese themes are exemplified when an athlete performs a movement correctly (i.e., adhering to the points of per-\nformance). The movement themes increase the potential for improved performance and minimize the risk of injury\nSound mechanics aid performance and risk management by using positions with the best mechanical and muscular\nalignment, conferring safety, efficacy, and efficiency simultaneously.\nMidLine sTabiLiZaTion\nA \u201cmidline\u201d is a plane of bilateral symmetry, but it is used in CrossFit to specifically refer to the relationship of the\nspine (base of the head to the top of the hips) and pelvis during functional movement. The midline trisects the spine\nand bisects the pelvis when the two are in their neutral anatomical relationship. Stabilization means something has\nbeen made stable, or \u201cstatic.\u201d Midline stabilization refers to the athlete\u2019s capacity to prevent movement from this\nneutral spinal position and is synonymous with core strength. Midline stabilization determines whether the athlete\ncan maintain the natural S-curve of the spine to the pelvis when dynamic and/or loaded. Some lifting applications\nrely on a midline posture with some extension past neutral in both the lumbar and thoracic regions. Regardless, this\nposture is maintained throughout the movement.\nStabilization of the spine is largely accomplished by engaging the abdominals (\u201cabs\u201d), internal and external oblique\nmuscles (\u201cobliques\u201d), and erector spinae (\u201cspinal erectors\u201d or simply \u201cerectors\u201d). Engaging the abs helps engage the\nspinal erectors and obliques; together, they create a belt of musculature around the vertebrae."}
{"262": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nTorso as a rigid, integrated structure\nThis neutral, static position maximizes performance because moving the torso as one rigid, integrated structure\nenables the transmission of force between the appendages and the object being lifted. In a push jerk, for example\nthe legs and hips extend force upward into the weight through the torso. A soft midline does not allow for the optima\ntransfer of force to the bar.\nWhen maintaining a neutral spine, the orientation of the vertebrae results in favorable distribution of forces and\nreduces the risk for injury. Where possible, it is ideal to have the midline in a vertical orientation because of the optima\nmuscular and skeletal alignment for force distribution (e.g., in a squat). As the torso moves from a vertical orientation\nas in the deadlift, the demand on the musculature to maintain a neutral spine increases. Forward movement of the\ntorso, however, does not increase the risk of injury if midline stabilization is present. It is when midline stabilization\nis lost that the shear force experienced by the spine increases. The human spine is more susceptible to injury when\nexposed to shear (vs. compression) forces. The resulting shear force attempts to push one vertebra past another\nwhile muscles and ligaments resist this loss of positioning. If the muscles and ligaments are not strong enough, an\ninjury to the spine may occur.\nDeviations from neutral\nDeviations from neutral may occur in flexion (bending forward from neutral) or extension (bending backward from\nneutral). Recall that a natural function of the abdominals is to flex the spine, so spinal flexion by itself is not nec-\nessarily problematic (e.g., getting out of bed) and is potentially beneficial to reduce the lever arm (e.g., gymnastics\nholds). Similarly, the erectors extend the spine. Extending past neutral is not inherently dangerous but can become\nso depending on degree of deviation and the load on the body.\nThe following hierarchy of spinal positioning is listed in order of increasing risk for injury:\n\u2022 Safest: Midline stabilization in a neutral position.\n\u2022 More risky: A non-neutral spine in a static position. Although less ideal than midline stabilization in\na neutral position, static positions (flexed or extended) prevent movement of the individual spinal\nsegments. This means no individual vertebra bears the majority of the lifting force.\n\u2022 Most risky: Loss of a neutral spine during movement, specifically when starting from neutral and moving\nto significant spinal flexion. This is potentially the most injurious, as there is movement of the individual\nspinal segments and one or a few vertebra(e) bear the majority of the lifting force.\nThe most common injury from a loss of midline stabilization occurs when the lumbar spine (L1\u2013L5) flexes under\nload, changing the normal concave curvature of the lower back to convex. Typically, flexion of the spine is seen with\nincreased hip flexion or when the midline is resisting a load on the front side of the body, as in a deadlift.\nAthletes may also deviate from neutral by overextending or hyperextending the spine, which means significantly\nbending backward from neutral into an injurious range of motion. There is a difference between the natural S-curva-\nture of the spine and an exaggerated extension of the spine. Placing athletes in an overextended position does not\nincrease the benefits of a neutral spine and may place them at risk for injury.\nHyperextension can result in the same injuries as excessive flexion (i.e., disc herniation or damage to facet joints)\nHyperextension generally occurs with more flexible athletes or occasionally with more advanced athletes. Over-"}
{"263": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nextension or hyperextension often points to a lack of engagement of the abdominals and can generally be addressed\nby cueing an athlete to tighten the abs. It is most often seen when an athlete lifts overhead.\nCORE-TO-EXTREMITY MOVEMENT\nCore-to-extremity movements demonstrate a sequence of muscular contraction that begins with the large force-pro-\nducing, low-velocity muscles of the core (abdominals and spinal erectors) and hips, and ends with the small force-pro-\nducing, high-velocity muscles of the extremities (e.g., biceps, calves, wrist flexors). Core-to-extremity movement\nbegins with establishing midline stabilization for effective force transfer\u2014i.e., a base is created and force radiates\nfrom there. This muscular patterning teaches the athlete to fluidly transmit power from one area of the body to\nanother. Core-to-extremity movement maximizes performance because it tasks the largest musculature to generate\nforce first, allowing the greatest forces to develop. This sequence improves efficiency and allows the greatest amount\nof work to be accomplished.\nCore-to-extremity movements are less risky than movements that violate this pattern because the largest muscles\nare tasked with generating the most force. Smaller muscle groups and associated tendons and ligaments are more\nsusceptible to injury, such as tearing, when exposed to loading designed for larger movers.\nCore-to-extremity movements are found everywhere, not just with movements that involve the arms and legs, so\nfaults can show up everywhere. Even a shoulder press or a deadlift may not effectively demonstrate core-to-extrem-\nity movement absent a stable midline. For dynamic faults, core-to-extremity violations occur when there is incorrect\ntiming and the arms move before the hips and legs have extended (i.e., pulling or pushing early).\nBALANCE ABOUT THE FRONTAL PLANE\nThe frontal plane divides the athlete into anterior and posterior halves. It is the plane about which one is balanced\nand it bisects the athlete at mid-foot. Referencing the athlete\u2019s movement (i.e., his or her line of action) and the object\nhe or she is moving relative to the frontal plane can often determine the athlete\u2019s efficiency.\nSignificant deviations of the athlete and/or object forward of the frontal plane prevent successful task completion\nespecially as the loading increases. These deviations can also impair other points of performance (i.e., neutral spine\nweight on the heels). Generally, moving an object along straight lines (i.e., in the frontal plane) can increase perfor-\nmance by increasing efficiency as the object follows the shortest distance between two points. Note, however, the\nathlete\u2019s movement accommodates the object and may or may not be characterized by straight lines. For example\nin a movement such as the squat, an effective line of action is created when the hips sit back and down as the knees\nbend. In this manner, the athlete is best able to keep the weight on the heels, and when the squat is loaded, the bar\ntravels along the shortest line. This movement also can reduce excessive force at the patella, which may occur if the\nknees translate excessively forward (i.e., such that the heels come up).\nBalance about the frontal plane can also be referenced in a kipping pull-up, where the plane is formed along the\nline from the hands to the floor. The athlete is most efficient when the center of mass oscillates about this plane to\nmaintain the most efficient timing of the swing. In the kipping pull-up, when the center of mass deviates from the\nfrontal plane too much, the athlete loses timing and has to reset the swing.\nA lack of balance about the frontal plane may increase the risk for injury because of increased potential for other\nmovement errors. For example, if the chest drops in a front squat with the bar deviating forward of the fronta"}

However, a violation of balance about the frontal plane by itself is not\nterribly risky.\nPOSTERIOR-CHAIN ENGAGEMENT\nThe posterior chain includes the group of muscles, tendons, and ligaments on the posterior (back) of the body, which\ncontains the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), gluteal muscles (\u201cglutes\u201d), and spina\nerectors. \u201cEngagement\u201d means this musculature contributes to the movement. Posterior-chain engagement does not\nrefer to using the posterior chain in an attempt to exclude the anterior chain. Ideally, there is a balance of pressure\nbetween the balls of the feet and the heels, with the line of action at the frontal plane. Posterior-chain engagement\nalso enables the athlete to maintain optimal knee alignment with the foot.\nInclusion of this large set of musculature on the backside of the body maximizes performance because of the\nincreased power generation, thereby resulting in faster speed to completion or increased load lifted. Keeping the\nheels rooted brings the load closer to the frontal plane, which helps the athlete stay balanced and drive the load up\nnot forward. This increases efficiency. Engagement of the spinal erectors is also essential for maintaining midline\nstabilization and providing the strongest base to transmit forces.\nFinally, engagement of the posterior chain helps keep the knees in line with the toes, where there is the best mechan-\nical position of leverage between the upper and lower leg. With posterior-chain engagement, greater musculature is\nrecruited to move the load, and enough room is created for full range of motion in a squatting movement. When the\nknees collapse inward, the center of pressure shifts forward (given the angle at which the knees flex). This positioning\nis often a result of underdeveloped external rotators of the hip.\nPosterior-chain engagement contributes to safety because it promotes midline stabilization and balance about the\nfrontal plane. Also, keeping the knees in line with the toes reduces lateral and rotational forces at the knee joint\nThese forces are problematic for a hinge joint such as the knee, where associated tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and\nmenisci could be damaged when poor mechanics are allowed to go unchanged over long periods of time. It is less\nlikely that a single repetition causes significant damage to the joints, but thousands of repetitions performed over\ntime can wear on the knees\u2019 structural integrity.\nPressure in the feet\nA lack of posterior-chain engagement results in the athlete (and/or object) shifting excessively forward of the fronta\nplane. A trainer can see this by observing the center of pressure in the feet in all movements, especially with any knee\nor hip flexion. This may or may not occur in conjunction with the heel coming off the floor. The heel can remain on the\nground while the center of pressure shifts forward.\nThis may also indicate premature shifting of weight to the toes, especially during an explosive hip extension, which\nresults in the hip extending forward rather than upward. If an athlete jumps forward during a lift, it may be an indica-\ntion of a premature shift of weight to the toes. \u201cTriple extension\u201d is not a forced calf raise in conjunction with exten-\nsion of the knees and hips; it is achieved when the heels leave the ground because of, and after, a violent extension\nthereby creating extension of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Analysis of elite lifters shows that the longer a lifter\nremains in contact with the ground during the second pull, the greater the acceleration on the bar. Greater surface\narea in contact with the ground enables a greater force to be transferred."}
{"265": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nKnee position\nWith regard to knee position, although there are two directions the knees can travel to come out of alignment with\nthe feet (laterally or medially), the fault is usually seen when the knees collapse inward (medially). The degree of devi-\nation in knee alignment generally increases with increased hip and knee flexion in a movement and/or wider stances\nAn athlete with a poor knee position in any movement often produces the error to some degree any time the knee\nflexes. For example, an athlete whose knees collapse in a squat is likely to have the knees collapse to a less obvious\ndegree in running, box jumps, push presses, etc.\nSOUND HIP FUNCTION\nSound hip function refers to the athlete\u2019s ability to flex and extend the hip to maximize its contribution to a move-\nment. The hamstrings and glutes are powerful hip extensors. Powerful and complete hip extension is necessary for\nelite athletic capacity because:\n1. it applies the most force on the object, and\n2. it creates the most elevation on the object, giving the athlete the most time to accommodate or receive it.\nThere are no major safety issues with slow or incomplete hip extension.\nPoor hip function is usually expressed in one of three ways:\n1. muted hip,\n2. lack of hip extension, and/or\n3. slow hip extension.\nA muted hip never closes/flexes (and therefore is a \u201cpermanently\u201d open hip). If the hip never closes, the movement is\npredominantly driven by the quadriceps. The quadriceps extend the knee without contribution from the hamstrings\nand glutes. Lack of hip extension does not allow the power of the hamstrings and glutes to be fully expressed. This\ndoes not effectively put acceleration on the bar or object and therefore does not elevate it to any significant degree\nEven small deviations from full hip extension result in reduced power transmission. The speed of hip extension\nplays a critical role in accelerating the object being lifted, particularly when the object must be elevated far beyond\nits starting point (e.g., from rack to overhead). In all cases, the power of the musculature of the hips is not opti-\nmally expressed.\nACTIVE SHOULDERS\nAn active shoulder provides the most stable position for the shoulder when working against a load. This means an\nactive shoulder is present in the overhead lifts as well as the deadlift series, including the deadlift, sumo deadlift high\npull, and medicine-ball clean. Outside the nine foundational movements, active shoulders are found in the kipping\npull-up, ring dip, handstand push-up, row, and snatch, among other movements.\nActive shoulders are about scapular position and stabilization and require different actions by the athlete, depend-\ning on the movement. In each movement, the athlete attempts to keep the shoulder in a relatively neutral, natura\nposition, without yielding to a load. At the same time, he or she will create enough space between the anatomica\nstructures of the shoulder so they may pass freely without impingement. Typically, this means an athlete demon-\nstrates an active shoulder by applying force in the direction opposite the load. For example, in an overhead squat, the\nathlete pushes up on the barbell. In a push-up, the athlete pushes down into the ground. In a row, the athlete pulls"}
{"266": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nback to prevent the rounding of the shoulders. There are also cases in which an active shoulder is not achieved by\npushing into the load (e.g., bench press). In all cases, the retraction, elevation, etc. is not taken to the end range that\nresults in a contrived position. For example, retraction in a deadlift is not full retraction that may result in a loss of\nmidline stabilization or a position that would not be possible under any real load.\nAn active shoulder creates optimal skeletal alignment, which enables the most musculature of the torso (e.g., tra-\npezius) to aid in the stability of the shoulder and potentiate the greatest force. An active shoulder also moves the\nacromion process out of the way of the humerus, reducing the chance for impingement of the biceps tendons and\nrotator-cuff muscles. The chances for impingement increase as the grip narrows. In an overhead squat, for example\na wider grip requires less elevation to create clearance space.\nWhen an athlete loses an active shoulder, the direction the shoulders move (e.g., forward, down) depends on the\nmovement. The coach needs to observe from where the force is being applied and determine if the shoulders are\nmoving in that same direction (e.g., yielding).\nfuLL range of MoTion abouT a JoinT\nFull range of motion about a joint describes the natural anatomical beginning and end positions of a movement. Ful\nrange of motion allows a greater complement of musculature to be used (e.g., reaching full depth in a squat, using\nactive shoulders) and in some cases better mechanical advantage (e.g., bar resting on the body in the front rack)\nJoint safety is maximized by preserving the range of motion required by life while best distributing forces at any one\njoint or throughout a series of joints. Additionally, increasing the musculature and joints involved allows the athlete\nto develop the neuromuscular coordination that is universally found in compound movements and sport.\nToward the other extreme, hyperextension or artificially trying to create more range of motion past a joint\u2019s natura\nanatomical function can be detrimental to joint health; more is not always better.\nTraining to the full range of motion in functional movements best prepares an individual for any conceivable task\nWhile life\u2019s tasks may not always require full range of motion, training to the limits of one\u2019s natural end range prevents\ndeficiencies if and when the joints need to move the full range. Using full range of motion preserves joint health, flex-\nibility, and strength, reducing the chance of injury and decrepitude later in life. If there is not a more pressing safety\nissue that needs to be fixed first, a trainer needs to preserve full range of motion above much else (e.g., adding load\nincreasing speed).\neffeCTive sTanCe and/or griP\nThis refers to the foot and hand positions adopted during a movement, where the optimal stance and grip promote\ntask accomplishment and the ability to display all the movement\u2019s points of performance.\nThere are two common stances in CrossFit. A narrower stance (hip width) is used in the deadlifts, presses, and the\nOlympic lifts. The hip-width stance promotes a more direct transfer of force through the heels/floor and into the\nobject being moved. A wider stance (shoulder width) is used in squatting movements, allowing for greater depth\nand contribution of the posterior chain. Some force-transfer efficiency may be lost with the wider stance (relative to\nhip width), but function and range of motion are gained. It is possible to take a different stance to allow for different\nloading mechanics. For example, a wider stance is adopted in the sumo deadlift. This allows the torso to remain more\nupright, allowing the legs and hips to more readily assist the back during the lift."}
{"267": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nThe grip is usually outside the shoulders or hips so as not to interfere with the object or other points of performance\nbut it may also be wider if the demands of the movement require it. For example, the grip in the deadlift should\nbe wide enough so as not to interfere with the legs, but it is significantly wider in the snatch to reduce the overal\ndistance the bar must travel.\nIn many real-life applications with odd objects, a wider stance or narrower grip may be used. It is critical for athletes\nto learn how to apply the other points of performance, regardless of the stance and grip used to accommodate an\nobject. This is especially true of preparing an athlete for situations outside the gym, when a more convenient stance\nand grip are not always possible.\nThere are no major safety concerns from a lack of effective stance or grip except when other points of performance\nare adversely affected. The value of any stance and grip adjustment should be assessed based upon its effect on al\nthe other points of performance in the movement.\nASSESSING SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE\nSimply observing an athlete\u2019s position in a movement does not provide enough of a context to assess safety risk and\nperformance benefit. Both are assessed in light of the individual\u2019s:\n1. athletic capacity,\n2. loading,\n3. positioning, and\n4. speed of execution.\nA trainer cannot identify bad positions without this greater context. Decreased performance and increased injury are\nmore likely as the athlete moves further from a sound position or as loads increase relative to the athlete\u2019s maximum\nFor example, picking up a grocery bag with a rounded back is a common occurrence and contains little safety risk\nfor many CrossFit athletes. Nevertheless, this same positioning could be more problematic for a beginner deadlifting\n135 lb. or an advanced competitive athlete deadlifting 500 lb.\nIn daily training, athletes are encouraged to exercise using the correct positions to develop strength and awareness\nUsing sound mechanics promotes greater potential for power development and decreases injury risk in the long\nterm. Training in the best positions, regardless of the load present, develops a sound default motor pattern that\nbetter prepares athletes for loaded and high-intensity scenarios.\nBecause of the benefits to safety, efficacy, and efficiency, proper mechanics are a daily focus of CrossFit trainers\nWorking toward better movement is not only for beginners and is arguably more important as the athlete advances\nThe margin for error decreases as load and speed increase. Top competitors rely on efficiencies that can create\nseconds of gain. A trainer cannot settle for anything less than excellent mechanics. For example, an immature squat\nmay be a safe position, but if the athlete can learn to lift the chest, every degree of elevation can increase the loads\nthat can be lifted in a clean or snatch, for example. A trainer must challenge himself or herself to develop better\nathletes beyond their current capacity."}
{"268": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nConCLusion\nThese themes provide a template from which a trainer can evaluate all movement in order to maximize both safety\nand performance for his or her athletes. The ability to recognize and correct violations is essential for a trainer\nregardless of whether the athlete\u2019s violation is major or minor.\nUnderstanding these themes provides a template for evaluating other approaches to coaching a movement. These\nthemes also can help a coach think critically about any methods before including them in instruction: If there is not\na clearly demonstrable mechanism that creates a safer or more effective movement, it is usually an unnecessary\ndistraction.\nFor example, suppose a coach considers a new starting posture for the snatch or clean. He or she wants to use a\ndynamic start such that the athlete moves through the setup without a pause before the first pull. If the athlete\nis able to achieve the common themes (e.g., midline stabilization, posterior-chain engagement, balance about the\nfrontal plane) in a static start and there is no clear performance gain from a dynamic start (i.e., increased loads lifted)\nit becomes an unnecessary layer of complexity to add to the mechanics of the lift.

{"271": "Heavy Days, continued\nHEAVY DAYS\nThere is the tendency for new CrossFit athletes and trainers to avoid heavy days entirely or execute them incorrectly.\nHowever, CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program. While people sometimes characterize CrossFit by its pro-\ngramming of mixed-modal workouts for time (\u201cmet-cons\u201d), this is a limited view. Days devoted to strength training\nare essential to CrossFit and are integral to CrossFit\u2019s prescription of constantly varied workouts.\nHeavy days are necessary to build top-end strength and power. Power output decreases with time, meaning that an\nathlete\u2019s work capacity in very short time domains sets the theoretical limit for his or her entire curve (Figure 1). It is\npossible to have high levels of short-duration power and little power elsewhere (e.g., a powerlifter), but it is impossi-\nble to have low levels of short-duration power and higher levels of longer-duration power. Therefore, heavy days are\nessential to a general physical preparedness program and should be used at least once a week or once every two\ncycles (where a cycle is three on, one off).\nfigure 1. Generalized work-capacity curve.\nHeavy days are not the only time athletes drive strength adaptations. Even within a metabolic-conditioning workout,\ndepending on the task and the capacity of the athlete, any number of exercises may build strength. Push-ups for\nnovices build pressing strength similar to a bench press, and attempting a 95-lb. thruster for a new CrossFit athlete\nbuilds squatting strength. As an athlete\u2019s strength increases, push-ups and 95-lb. thrusters tend to favor other adap-\ntations such as stamina, and greater loads are necessary to further increase top-end power.\nHeavy days can be completed with most any weightlifting or gymnastics movement, such as weighted dips and\npull-ups and lifting odd objects (e.g., sandbags, axles). More often than not, however, a barbell is best because it is\nimpossible to match the barbell\u2019s ease and range of loading with other equipment. Heavy days may also include all\nvariations of standard barbell movements (e.g., hang, power, from a deficit, pulling from pins/bumpers)."}
{"272": "Heavy Days, continued\nRepetition schemes\nThe heavy-day workout consists of small sets, most often in the range of 1 to 5 repetitions, where the total volume of\nworking repetitions is approximately 7 to 25. Repetitions significantly outside this range do not produce the desired\nresponse. If there are too few repetitions (e.g., one repetition of a near-maximum load), the athlete does not produce\nenough stress on the taxed muscles to drive a new adaptation. Conversely, too many repetitions (e.g., 30 or more\nrepetitions of near-maximum load) produces too much stress for the athlete to recover from in a reasonable time\nperiod. The working sets generally occur at or above 80\u201385 percent of a 1-repetition-maximum load, and warm-up\nsets used to get to this loading do not count toward the total working repetitions. This is not an exact percentage\nbut a working set should be heavy enough to require concentrated effort. The working sets also do not produce a\nsignificant cardiorespiratory response.\nRepetition schemes may vary. As a general guideline, the higher the repetitions in a set or across the entire session\nthe lower the loading. This tends to better develop muscular stamina and/or technique. The lower the repetitions\nthe higher the loading. This tends to better develop top-end strength. Both approaches should be used. Repetition\npatterns include standard schemes such as 7 x 1, 5 x 3, 5 x 5 (sets x reps); pyramid-like patterns of 1-2-3-2-1 (reps\nper set); descending/ascending schemes such as 5-4-3-2-1 (reps per set); no set specificity (e.g., work up to a max\npush press); and on-the-minute training (1, 2, or 3 repetitions on the minute, every minute for 10 minutes), among\nothers. Failed attempts count toward working sets. However, the goal of a session should be to complete the majority\nof the lifts.\nHeavy days are for everyone: the young, old, fit, and unfit. Using the concept of relative intensity, a trainer has each\nathlete lift a load that is relatively heavy for him or her. Even beginners should participate, although a trainer should\nbe more cautious progressing a new athlete in load. Trainers can potentially give beginners more repetitions (either\nwithin each set or by increasing the total number of sets) to very gradually progress to a reasonably challenging\nworking weight while instilling appropriate mechanics. Relatively new athletes often set a personal record every time\nthey lift heavy. As the lifter becomes more experienced, sessions without a new personal record may occur. Setting\na personal record is not necessary to reap the benefits of lifting heavy.\nMinimizing risk\nAs risk increases with load, the trainer has several safety concerns to manage when leading a strength session. A\nheavy-day class best begins with a thorough warm-up to prepare the athletes for maximal loading (e.g., increase\ncore temperature and improve range of motion). It also provides the trainer with an opportunity to correct and\nrefine mechanics across warm-up sets of the movement to minimize risk. Finding the best way to complete warm-up\nsets usually becomes an intuitive process as athletes become more experienced with lifting heavy. However, most\nathletes in their first few years still need direction through this section. Common practice for warm-up sets is at\nleast 3 to 5 warm-up sets, where the sets start with a lighter weight/higher repetition count and progress to heavier\nweight/lower repetition count. The rest periods in the warm-up sets do not need to be as long as during the working\nsets. Whatever the warm-up is, trainers cannot fatigue the athlete for the work sets. Instead, warm-up sets gradually\nprime the body for heavier loading while refining the mechanics of the lift.\nThe trainer must also teach each athlete how to bail and/or spot as necessary before any significant weight is\nattempted. It is easiest to have participants practice this with a PVC or dowel. A trainer cannot assume athletes\nwill perform bailing or spotting techniques correctly without specific instructions. The gym floor also needs to be"}

Trainers may choose to have participants share racks, in part to reduce equipment and space needs. Sharing\nracks also allows athletes to help one another with loading, unloading, and spotting. It also allows for adequate\nrest time between sets so athletes fully recover. When using racks, additional instructions are needed to ensure\nthat athletes keep enough distance between themselves and the racks when lifting. The trainer needs to clearly\ndescribe how the working sets should be approached to avoid confusion. For example, the workout may be 5 x 5\nfront squats. Does the trainer want the athletes to try to increase the load with every set? Does the trainer want the\nathletes to hold a certain percentage across all sets? Or does the trainer perhaps want the athletes to find a new\n5-repetition maximum, meaning the exact number of working sets is less important (maybe it takes 4 sets, maybe\n5 sets)? All these approaches have validity and potential benefits, but the trainer needs to indicate what the intent is\non a particular day.\nDuring the working sets, the trainer must appropriately apply the principles of threshold training just as he or she\nwould in any other workout. Once an athlete\u2019s mechanics significantly deviate from the points of performance, the\nload needs to be reduced. This is especially true when multiple verbal and visual cues do not result in any improve-\nment in mechanics. It is possible that the trainer can fix the mechanics at lighter loads and then allow the athlete to\nagain increase the load gradually. Deviations from points of performance may also require the trainer to change the\nmovement for a few repetitions before using the entire movement (e.g., using snatch pulls to correct an athlete who\nis pulling early in the full snatch). Once the workout is complete, the trainer should include equipment clean-up and\nworkout logging as part of the cool-down period.\nCueing during a heavy lifting session needs to be very direct. The athlete\u2019s attention will be almost solely focused\non the effort required to complete the lift. The trainer will have little time or opportunity to impact the quality of the\nmovement during the set. Therefore, cues need to be short, easy to implement, and delivered with an intensity that\nmatches the effort of the lift. If more technical consideration is needed, the time between sets can be a great oppor-\ntunity to elaborate. However, upon returning to the next set, the athlete should have a very clear picture of what he or\nshe needs to focus on. Giving your athlete more than one or two things to think about often results in no change at all\nConCLusion\nTrainers need to regularly program strength days with their clients and ensure all participants achieve the desired\nstimulus during the training session. These sessions provide coaches and athletes with opportunities to improve\nmechanics, acquire new skills, and see progress in a modality that is vital to developing the fitness CrossFit seeks."}

During the Level 1\nnutrition lecture, participants were walked through the importance of eating quality foods, and there was discussion\nof a few common ways to quantify food intake. Eating meats, vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and\nno sugar in combination with weighing and measuring macronutrient quantities can have a profound effect on one\u2019s\nhealth and performance outcomes.\nA tsunami of chronic disease has been sweeping across the world, and CrossFit affiliates are the lifeboats. Each gym\nhas within its walls the necessary ingredients to make profound changes to one\u2019s health.\nAs a coach, knowing what to eat, how to eat, and why it is important is only half the battle. The real struggle is in\nimplementing dietary changes and trying to create a high level of compliance.\nPerhaps one of the most important aspects of behavior change is one\u2019s belief that he or she is capable of making a\nspecific change. This is considered one\u2019s self-efficacy.\nIt is very important for coaches to know they have everything they need in the gym to increase an athlete\u2019s self-effi-\ncacy. Coaches should feel equipped to set up the perfect intervention to get athletes eating better for long periods\nof time, if not indefinitely.\nIt is up to the coach to help increase athletes\u2019 self-efficacy and encourage them to believe that changes are possible.\nIncreases in self-efficacy are a result of:\n\u2022 Mastery experiences: These are small achievable steps throughout the process. Success in these steps will\nincrease self-belief (i.e., adding vegetables to each meal).\n\u2022 A coach\u2019s ability to adjust to different emotional and physiological states: A coach must adjust to how others\nperceive change and deal with stress (i.e., be sensitive to the fact that Rebecca has always eaten this way,\nand she has three young children to consider).\n\u2022 Vicarious experiences: Coaches should use the successes of others to convince athletes that they, too, can\nbe successful (i.e., Joe started by cutting out low-quality food for a month. Then he would quantify only his\nbreakfast. Eventually, he measured his lunch, and six months later, he has lost 40 lb.).\n\u2022 Verbal/social persuasion: Athletes should receive verbal support from others, including from role models\n(the trainer) and/or in small groups (i.e., create an accountability buddy, send reminders, videos, articles\ncontaining any material that motivates the individual to stay the course).\nThese are four factors that affect self-efficacy (Bandura). These factors should be sought in combination with each\nother for best results.\nWhen thinking about behavior change within the context of a gym environment, we can understand the stages of\nchange as contemplation, action, and maintenance. These three stages apply most accurately to the gym environ-\nment and the relationship between coach and athlete."}
{"280": "Nutrition, continued\nContemplation: The athlete has a desire to make a change and recognizes that his or her behavior may be problematic\nAction: The behavior change has been initiated and healthier behaviors are being acquired.\nMaintenance: There is sustained healthy behavior and the athlete has developed the skills to deal with relapse.\nA key component to successfully changing behavior and progressing through each stage is self-efficacy. Does the\nathlete believe in his or her ability to change eating habits and to eat the optimal ratios and amounts?\nConTeMPLaTion\nA coach must first educate. Teaching the art of nutrition is no different than teaching functional movements. It stil\nrequires an in-depth knowledge of the material:\n\u2022 What are quality foods? What are unhealthy foods? How do you replace the unhealthy foods with healthier\nchoices?\n\u2022 How do you quantify macronutrients, and what tools are needed to weigh and measure?\n\u2022 Why is changing your diet important, and what are the expected outcomes?\n\u2022 What skills do you need to make this change and maintain it?\nCoaches then need to find the best way to communicate this information to their athletes. The explanation must be\nsimple, actionable, and realistic. This starts the process of building the skill set and producing the incentives required\nto make meaningful changes to diet.\nSuccessful gyms have accomplished this in a number of ways.\n\u2022 Small Nutrition Talks\n{ These talks are often provided during introductory sessions.\n{ Each small talk builds on the one prior. Athletes continue to develop knowledge and enhance skills\nin small steps (mastery experiences).\n{ Typically, food logs are used to determine necessary changes. This food log can easily be used in the\nlatter stages of change.\n\u0083 Any errors in the food log should be identified, and there should be positive and actionable\nsteps to fix them.\n{ Athletes are provided with everything, from shopping lists to recipes.\n\u0083 This level of information is necessary to actually perform the new behavior. The assumption\nthat building a shopping list is easy is one of the reasons many do not succeed. The coach\nmust guide this process.\n\u2022 Large Nutrition Lectures\n{ Typically, these are lectures that cover everything from eating quality foods to using different ways\nto weigh and measure food.\n{ The information is provided all at once to a large group of athletes, typically with a question and\nanswer session at the end.\n{ These tend to be used as an introduction to nutrition challenges.\n\u0083 The main points might be covered again in a small group format during the challenge.\nIt is important to understand that how someone perceives the journey will also have a profound impact on the results\nPerception is reality.

{"281": "Nutrition, continued\n\u2022 If an athlete is depressed, anxious, or scared about the behavior change, there will likely be a negative\nimpact on the outcome. The barriers to undertaking the behavior change might seem more severe than\nthey actually are.\n\u2022 Obviously, not everyone reacts this way to negative stress. Some are very confident in their abilities.\nMaybe they have some past experience with being a high-level athlete, or they are very successful in other\nareas of their life. These experiences can be used as a way to sustain efforts necessary for optimal results.\n\u2022 That being said, the majority of the people who are trying to progress from sickness to wellness will have\nsome level of self-doubt, fear, or anxiety.\nA good coach is sensitive to the state of the athlete and finds ways to relieve stress and make the experience positive\nThis becomes very important in group nutrition challenges. Remember, half the battle is instilling belief in the athletes\nthat they can do it. Consider the following:\n\u2022 Being part of a group can be extremely intimidating, especially if you are the least fit.\n\u2022 Successful coaches key into this right away and find a mentor to work closely with this type of athlete.\nMentors should be positive, relatable, and reliable.\n\u2022 Sometimes, the coach becomes the mentor and makes himself or herself available for extra guidance and\nmotivation.\naCTion\nOnce the athlete is ready to start, the coach needs to find ways to initiate change and keep it going. It is easy to\ncomplete a nutrition challenge and then fall back into old habits, eating the same way as before.\nVicarious experiences\nOne way a trainer can keep this behavior going is to provide vicarious experiences.\n\u2022 Find members that have had long-term success and use their stories. These people are now role models\nand their journeys are powerful!\n\u2022 If you don\u2019t have these people within your own gym, look for them in the community. There are countless\nexamples of people who have found significant results with changes to diet and consistent CrossFit training.\n\u2022 It is important that you use a variety of real-life success stories, and the closer to home, the better.

At the same time, they will have developed the confidence and strength they need to continue to\nexperience the benefits of this lifestyle change.\nSuccess stories need to be shared regularly by any means possible. This could be on the website, social media plat-\nforms, or within and on the walls of the gym itself. The more exposure and opportunity to highlight the success of\nothers, the better.\n\u2022 Try to provide as much detail as you can.\n{ What was the person\u2019s starting point?\n{ Where did he or she struggle?\n{ How did the person get through the tough times?\n{ What is he or she doing to stay on target?"}

If an athlete is overwhelmed by the idea of completely changing his or her\nfood quality, weighing and measuring food, and starting a CrossFit program, it might make sense to walk the athlete\nthrough this transition one step at a time.\n\u2022 Mastery experiences can come in the form of incremental changes to the diet and celebrations of small\nvictories.\n\u2022 The coach needs to provide actionable steps for the athlete to achieve his or her goals, and athletes need\nto believe that these steps are achievable.\n\u2022 Providing achievable small steps can come in the form of simply helping an athlete create one healthy\nmeal at a time. Satisfying this challenge will boost an athlete\u2019s confidence in his or her abilities and help in\nthe pursuit of the next step.\n\u2022 After athletes have shown they can successfully and consistently create a healthy meal, the coach should\nchallenge them to create two. This is the journey.\nThere are successful gyms that start challenges with step-by-step elimination.

{"286": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nPROGRAM DESIGN AND SCALING\nCrossFit is defined as \u201cconstantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity,\u201d with the goal to develop\nfitness that prepares one optimally for any task imaginable. The programming material of the Level 1 Course outlines\nworkout variables and basic considerations for structuring workouts. The programming material at this course builds\non that foundation by focusing on long-term program design for individuals and groups.\nAmong the myriad variables to control when programming workouts, a trainer cannot lose sight of the small influ-\nence programming has among a host of other factors that determine a client\u2019s success. Programming, whether\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d is secondary to effective coaching, appropriate scaling, using sound mechanics, and developing a\ngroup dynamic conducive to pushing oneself (i.e., highest intensity brought to the work). Even with less-than-optimal\nprogramming, a trainer who has a good eye for movement mechanics and develops a good rapport with his or her\nclients will help people improve their fitness for years. Functional movements performed at high intensity, regard-\nless of how well they are combined and varied, are powerful enough to elicit dramatic changes in one\u2019s health and\nperformance, particularly for the unaccustomed. Therefore, trainers can spend more time focusing on their skill set\nand member rapport rather than striving beyond reason to create the \u201cperfect\u201d template and programming cycles.\nANALYZING PROGRAMMING FOR EFFECTIVENESS\nEffective or \u201cgood\u201d programming produces results, and the relative degree to which programming is effective is the\ndegree to which it optimizes fitness. The standard by which to evaluate any programming is measurable improve-\nment in performance markers. For a CrossFit athlete, results would include increased loads on heavy days, decreased\ntimes on task-priority workouts, and increased repetitions or rounds on time-priority workouts. An optimal program\nwould see the maximum possible increases in any test of fitness.\nOther measurable markers include health markers. Faster Fran times, more rounds of Cindy, and heavier 1-repe-\ntition-maximum clean and jerks are correlated with decreases in blood pressure, triglycerides, and resting heart\nrate. Additional results may be reported by clients, such as improved quality of life, improved confidence, increased\nenergy, and mood alteration. Anecdotal improvements in quality of life are side benefits of CrossFit. While not mea-\nsurable, they are valued by many clients over the metrics of improved workout statistics and health markers.\nIneffective programming does not produce results, or at least not to the same degree possible with effective pro-\ngramming. These suboptimal results could include decreased performance on benchmark workouts, merely modest\nimprovements in performance markers, or even a higher rate of injury, which could be easily avoided by following\nother programming.\nThe key is that program effectiveness is based on results: real changes in measurable, observable, repeatable\nmarkers. Clients need to get results for the programming to be deemed effective.\nTrainers programming for a group or an entire affiliate can simply use the same measurement applied across the\nentire gym population. A trainer can look for long-term trends and patterns in the group by assessing performance\non select benchmarks. For example, a trainer may select specific benchmarks to follow: He or she may track clients\n1-repetition-maximum snatch, 1-repetition-maximum back squat, Grace, Fran, Tabata squats, 1-mile run, JT, Fight\nGone Bad, 5-km row, and Cindy as his or her fitness tests. An evaluation does not have to include these exact"}

As long as\nthe majority of members are improving their scores on these days, the programming is effective. A trainer must\nremember that this is a long-term view, and he or she cannot expect everyone to set a personal record (PR) with every\nbenchmark test due to variables beyond his or her control, such as mood, sleep, stress, the physiology of the athlete\nand even the athlete\u2019s commitment to the program. Intermediate to advanced athletes, for example, cannot expect\nto set personal records every time they repeat a workout due to the decreased magnitude of adaptations that result\nfrom increased proficiency (i.e., the learning curve).\nvarianCe in CrossfiT PrograMMing\n\u201cVariance\u201d refers to the intended variation of functional movements, loads, repetition schemes, and time durations\nwithin a single workout and across a series of workouts in order to best maximize one\u2019s fitness. Other factors (e.g.\nenvironment, gear) can be varied but are not the primary variables to consider. The variation of workout variables\nacross months and years determines how well one is prepared for any conceivable test of fitness. A program with\na narrow focus may show great results in one area but have little impact on another. For example, a powerlifting\nprogram may see increases in strength and power for certain lifts, but it might produce worse performance in lon-\nger-duration, higher-repetition scenarios or even decreased strength and power in certain other lifts, like the snatch\nIn the name of variance, there are few absolutes for formulating the infinite combinations of workout variables. An\nerror in programming variance is only problematic when the error becomes routine. Today\u2019s workout does not have a\ndramatic impact on one\u2019s fitness; it is the series of workouts that result in long-term change. Programming too many\nheavy days in a row, for example, develops a narrow capacity. Conversely, programming a few heavy days back-to-\nback on occasion may be an entirely appropriate or beneficial stimulus.\nLong-term planning and routine assessment\nEffectively combining workout variables over the long term requires intentional and careful planning. The program-\nmer must be well versed in CrossFit methodology to understand similar and disparate stimuli, as well as which\nstimuli are the most potent. Programming requires reviewing what has been completed recently in an attempt to\nprovide new variance. It must also allow for routine assessment to ensure progress is occurring.\nTo a lesser degree, the programmer must understand each athlete\u2019s current capacity and weaknesses. For any\nlevel of athlete, a well-varied program should cover many different aspects of fitness. As an athlete becomes more\nadvanced (e.g., a CrossFit Games competitor), additional time may be needed to improve weaknesses in addition to\nregular CrossFit programming. Regardless, effective programming cannot be random. Although CrossFit program-\nming appears random to some due to its non-linear and non-formulaic pattern, its variety is a result of a planned\nattempt to address all fitness tests. This does not happen by the luck of the draw.\nCrossFit.com programming\nCrossFit.com provides a great expression of variance for general physical preparedness. An athlete who can perform\nall main-site workouts as prescribed (Rx\u2019d) has a robust fitness capacity. Across all the workouts on CrossFit.com\nsome very broad trends suggest some combinations are more useful than others to develop this level of fitness\nCrossFit more frequently programs whole-body, natural, high-power movements in short, intense workouts because\nof their far-reaching effects on one\u2019s overall fitness. These principles are generally expressed in task-priority couplets\nand triplets of 15 minutes or less, which include full-body, high-power movements utilizing complementary functions\n(e.g., pulling vs. pressing). This simple, but highly effective\u2014i.e., elegant\u2014programming drives CrossFit\u2019s potency. A"}
{"288": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nprogrammer cannot be fooled into believing the simplicity of the movements and combinations equates to \u201csimple\u201d\nresults. Complexity does not inherently produce greater efficiency or efficacy, and arguably it detracts from both.\nClassic CrossFit benchmark workouts such as Fran, Helen, Diane, Elizabeth, and Fight Gone Bad are all excellent\nexamples of these basic principles. Fran (21-15-9 repetitions of thrusters and pull-ups) is an elegant combination\ntwo full-body movements, complementary in function (lower-body push and upper-body pull) to allow intensity to\nremain high while simultaneously expressing functions necessitated by life (squatting, putting an object overhead\npulling the body up).\nCrossFit programming is best summarized in World-Class Fitness in 100 Words, by CrossFit Founder Coach Greg\nGlassman: \u201cPractice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C & J (clean and jerk), and snatch. Similarly\nmaster the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips\nsplits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc., hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many\ncombinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly\nlearn and play new sports.\u201d\nAlthough many CrossFit workouts follow these trends, not all should. Less frequently, athletes need to be exposed to\nworkouts that are more unorthodox. For example, there are times when workout variables that result in decreased\npower output are entirely beneficial for an individual. A load that may be too heavy for an athlete to move con-\ntinuously in a workout is also a stimulus for greater strength. A high-repetition scheme that causes the athlete to\nstop multiple times in a single set is a stimulus for greater stamina. Even using lower-powered movements such\nas a Turkish get-up in a workout are useful occasionally for developing greater coordination, balance, and shoulder\nstrength under cardiorespiratory stress. The bulk of workouts, however, should strive for simple, bold pairings.\noPTiMiZing CrossfiT PrograMMing\nMost every client can improve his or her fitness without individualized programming. Small adjustments in the\ncontext of regular CrossFit programming, such as weakness work and scaling workouts appropriately, can accelerate\na client\u2019s results within general group programming.\nWorking weaknesses\nA weakness is a certain skill that is lacking relative to an athlete\u2019s proficiency in other areas. By improving one\u2019s\ncapacity in these weak areas, the athlete\u2019s overall fitness increases. Effective CrossFit programming by itself is aimed\ntoward improving weaknesses. With well-varied, unbiased combinations of loads, time durations, movements\netc., clients inevitably see improvements in their fitness for years. Over the months and years, just performing the\nelements one struggles with will improve one\u2019s proficiency in these movements.\nAn athlete may choose to do additional weakness work to accelerate progress and will likely find this also improves\nstrengths. Working on weaknesses is also important for clients who have reached a plateau. Coach Glassman has\nasserted the following: \u201cThere is more traction, more advantage, more opportunity in pursuing that one thing that\nyou don\u2019t want to see come out (of the hopper) headlong than to put more time into that thing you\u2019re already good\nat. That thing that you don\u2019t want to see come out is a chink in your armor. And addressing it will make a difference\nfor you in ways that you\u2019ll never be able to predict.\u201d"}
{"289": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nIt is unlikely that the programming needs to change drastically to address weaknesses, particularly for an affiliate\nor large group setting. Further, trying to tailor the program to every individual weakness is impossible. The best the\ntrainer can do is to observe and respond to the general trends in the gym and provide well-varied programming\nconsistently.\nConstant assessment is needed to ensure that too much capacity is not lost in the strong areas. When assessment\nhas shown that the weak areas are now at an acceptable level, the trainer should look to identify the next area\nof weakness and make small adjustments accordingly. A radical change in programming is likely to eliminate the\nbenefits experienced elsewhere (e.g., programming becomes too skewed toward the new goal).\nIf the programming becomes too skewed toward working on specific elements, then it is biased. Biasing is program-\nming certain elements more frequently regardless of current capacity in those areas. Biasing does not necessarily\nresult in an increase in fitness; it results in an increase in a specific capacity. Biasing is not necessarily negative if it\nserves the athlete\u2019s preference or goal. It is only a problem when the athlete is seeking general fitness and continues\nto follow a biased program. Addressing weaknesses may eventually become a bias in the absence of assessment.\nWeakness work can be easily included in the warm-up of the class, focusing on the technique of one of the more chal-\nlenging movements. This gives clients extra practice time to improve a deficiency and potentially allows for a more\n\u201cpersonalized\u201d program. During warm-up and skill sessions, which are often heavily biased toward newer and less\nproficient athletes, an effective trainer needs to also offer challenging options for the advanced athletes.\nFor example, suppose a trainer led a warm-up that included a skill session on pistols. Although most of the athletes\nmay be working on getting their first pistol, perhaps using a band or squatting to a box with a support, advanced\nathletes may be working on weighted pistols (e.g., with a bar in the overhead-squat position). There are examples of\nhow to use warm-ups to implement weakness work in the \u201cExample Warm-ups to Address Weaknesses\u201d section of\nthis training guide. With well-varied workouts, much of the warm-up can coincide with movement preparation for the\nworkout to practice elements that are usually weak (e.g., handstand push-ups, muscle-ups, double-unders).\nRegardless of the movements selected, trainers should be sure to avoid pre-fatiguing the client. The goal of the\nwarm-up is not to make it another workout. An example of a poor choice of warm-up may be doing three rounds of\n15 pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, and hip extensions before the workout Cindy (as many repetitions as possible\nin 20 minutes of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats). Pre-fatigue is of particular concern when a trainer plans\na longer skill session before the workout, such as handstand push-up skill work before the workout Diane (21-15-9\nrepetitions of deadlifts and handstand push-ups). Such skill work can be done, but the trainer must monitor the\nvolume such that the athletes are not unduly fatigued. Each athlete has variable tolerance to pre-workout volume\nrelative to that athlete\u2019s capacity. The tolerance builds over time, so the warm-up can eventually be more extensive\nwithout pre-fatiguing muscles.\nTemplates can be used for weakness work. They can help keep a coach or athlete committed to dedicating time to\nskill development. However, it is important for coaches and athletes to use their judgment to change or break from\nthe template as necessary.\nScaling effectively\nScaling workouts appropriately for one\u2019s clients is an essential consideration to best increase their fitness. This is not"}
{"290": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\njust a concept for beginner clients; an effective trainer progresses the most athletes toward completing workouts as\nprescribed across months and years.\nTo scale effectively, a trainer needs to review the original workout for its intended stimulus, including:\n\u2022 movement functions,\n\u2022 loading parameters,\n\u2022 time frame, and\n\u2022 volume of repetitions.\nThis does not have to be a formal process, but it helps identify appropriate scaling options.\nSuppose an affiliate decided to post the workout Amanda (9-7-5 repetitions of muscle-ups and 135-lb. snatches) for\nits daily classes. This is a workout most members at most affiliates have to scale. The basic analysis of the workout\nvariables shows:\n1. a high-skill gymnastics movement that is an upper-body pull and push and a high-skill weightlifting\nmovement that is predominantly a lower-body pull and squat,\n2. the intended loading is moderate,\n3. the intended time is short (approximately 5 minutes), and\n4. the volume is low.\nThe goal for scaling this workout is to adhere to as many of these variables as possible in light of the individual\u2019s\ncapacity. The resulting scaled workout still needs to provide each client with a significant challenge. There is no single\nstrategy that works in every situation. Scaling is also a \u201cmoving target\u201d as individual capacities change over time.\nThere are some populations for which a trainer can employ common scaling strategies:\n1. beginners and/or deconditioned individuals,\n2. intermediate athletes,\n3. advanced athletes, and\n4. injured athletes.\nScaling guidelines, and examples for the workout Amanda, are detailed below.\nBeginners and/or deconditioned individuals are generally those athletes who have been doing CrossFit for six months\nor less. For beginner and/or deconditioned individuals, a trainer needs to be primarily concerned with adherence to\nthe proper points of performance of the movements throughout the full range of motion. Increasing the difficulty\n(via movements or volume) and/or pushing for greater intensity (via speed or load) are secondary to developing\nmovement proficiency and new skill development. This group may often include the elderly, where additional safety\nconcerns may be necessary (e.g., keeping feet on the floor). Beginners need a lot of guidance: The trainer must be\nproactive about approaching them and modifying the workout.\nLoads, distances, and repetitions are the primary variables to modify during scaling, particularly before changing the\nmovement. If a movement is beyond the athlete\u2019s current abilities, a substitution should create a similar movement\nfunction and range of motion. In some cases, preserving function and range of motion can be done by using severa\nmovements to achieve a similar effect. Also, it is not \u201cstandard\u201d to increase the volume of the substituted or \u201cless"}
{"291": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nchallenging\u201d movement. For example, it is not necessary to always make those substituting single-unders for dou-\nble-unders complete two or three times the repetitions. This group often needs reduced volume, even with a substi-\ntuted movement.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for beginners/deconditioned individuals include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Reduce to whatever allows the athlete to best practice the movement with full range\nof motion. This may be a training bar, empty barbell, or even PVC pipe. If the athlete has to go very light\nto preserve movement mechanics, consider doubling the repetition scheme. This gives the athlete more\npractice repetitions, which is the primary concern for the inexperienced. It is also possible to reduce the\nrange of motion in a loaded scenario if the mechanics cannot otherwise be preserved. Regardless of the\nscaling choice, the workout should provide some challenge across the repetitions.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. Replace with a simple upper-body pull and push. Most likely, this will be jumping\npull-ups or ring rows, and squat-assisted dips, bench dips, or push-ups. These options are mechanically\nsimple relative to the muscle-up, so a trainer needs to pick an option that provides a challenge to the\nathlete\u2019s upper-body strength across the total repetitions.\nAlthough not an exact guideline, the term \u201cintermediate athletes\u201d generally describes those who have been doing\nCrossFit for six months to three years. An intermediate athlete is one who can perform some workouts as prescribed\nbut still struggles with more complex movements or challenging repetition schemes and loads. Scaling the repeti-\ntions on some gymnastics movements and the loads on some weightlifting movements is the main priority. A trainer\nmust be mindful that an intermediate athlete is best served by using different scaling options each time a particular\nmovement or load appears in a workout. A trainer can create several different options for intermediate athletes\nnot only to avoid boredom, but also to help them continue to develop their fitness. Varying the manner in which a\nworkout is scaled reduces the timeframe needed to acquire the desired adaptation.\nWith time, intermediate athletes should be able to adequately scale their own workouts. This comes with a better\nunderstanding of workout goals and their own strengths and weaknesses. Intermediate athletes may be incor-\nrectly neglected at times because they require less guidance than the beginner. Nevertheless, the majority of one\u2019s\nmembers will likely be intermediate athletes with a wide range of abilities. These athletes still need to be pushed to\nnew levels as appropriate.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for intermediate athletes include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Intermediate athletes often include individuals who should stay at the prescribed\nweight and potentially take longer to complete the workout. Although their power output may be lower\nthan if the load was scaled, keeping the load as prescribed helps develop exactly the strength and\nstamina needed to perform the workout in a more competitive time. In cases where this load would\nnot be completed in any realistic time frame (i.e., would take more than 20 minutes), reduce the load\nappropriately.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. The scale is best when it is specific to the weakness, and it therefore does not take\non one specific form. If they have significant upper-body capacity in pull-ups and dips, an effective scale\nwould be to work a transition drill, as that is where their capacity is lacking (i.e., working the transition\nhelps strengthen a greater range of motion at the shoulder). Conversely, an intermediate athlete who"}
{"292": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nstruggles with pull-ups and dips may be better served using those movements in the workout to develop\nthe pushing and pulling stamina and strength of the upper body. Depending on proficiency, perhaps the\nrepetitions of pull-ups and dips should be increased. If there is an athlete who has muscle-ups but is not\nconsistent with them or cannot perform a high volume, reducing the repetitions is a viable option to help\ntrain the skill in a mixed-modal environment (e.g., repetitions of 5-4-3).\nAdvanced-level athletes are those who can perform all workouts and movements as prescribed. Typically, these\nathletes either came to CrossFit after years of performing some functional movements at high intensities (e.g., col-\nlegiate gymnast) or they have been doing CrossFit consistently for years. There are times a trainer needs to scale\nthis athlete due to sickness, injury, personal problems, or a recent string of difficult/demanding workouts. Occasion-\nally suggesting a variation with lower loading and/or repetitions benefits the advanced athlete both physically and/\nor mentally.\nThere may be an occasion to \u201cscale up\u201d an individual if the athlete is not challenged by the repetition scheme or weight\nor is in need of a different stimulus for skill development. The obvious options are to increase load or repetitions\nchoose different equipment (dumbbells vs. barbells), or make a movement more difficult (parallette vs. regular hand-\nstand push-ups). A trainer needs to be wary of this practice and should avoid consistently making workouts heavier\nand higher in volume to provide a \u201cchallenge.\u201d More often than not, the advanced athlete needs to be coached to\nbetter movement mechanics and/or greater intensity before making a workout \u201charder.\u201d An effective trainer needs to\nfocus on fixing movement inefficiencies and pushing for faster speeds before increasing the weights and repetitions\nThese corrections translate to seconds of gain in performance.\nCoaches need to be sure not to confuse advanced for elite, where elite is reserved for individuals actually going to the\nGames. Competitive programming is outside the scope of this course, as well as outside the scope of most affiliate\nneeds. At a minimum, athletes should be considered advanced before more volume is needed.\nSome potential scaling options for an advanced athlete in Amanda are listed below. There are infinite ways to tweak\nthe workout based on needs and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the athlete. These would be good options\nparticularly when an advanced athlete already has a competitive Amanda time.\n\u2022 Snatch. The snatch may be made heavier, may become a power variation, may be replaced with heavy\ndumbbells, etc.\n\u2022 Muscle-up. The muscle-ups may become bar muscle-ups, strict muscle-ups, weighted muscle-ups,\nmuscle-ups to forward rolls, etc.\nThe fourth category of participants includes the injured athlete. These individuals should be encouraged to par-\nticipate in the workout, as there is benefit to training even in their reduced capacity. There is a positive hormona\nresponse from exercise, which can affect a multitude of factors, from body weight to recovery to mental state\nAlthough the nature of injury determines what is possible, the goal is still the same: to replicate all workout variables\nas closely as possible.\nPain-free range of motion is the main guideline. Where the movement cannot be performed exactly, a trainer should\nfind a substitute that best replicates the basic function and/or range of motion. However, any movement that stil\nrelies primarily on the injured joint/body part should be used cautiously, if at all. A trainer may need to get creative at\ntimes to help athletes avoid boredom and keep an injured athlete working for new skill acquisition."}
{"293": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nSingle-limb work can be utilized: Contrary to the belief that this results in a problematic muscular imbalance, exer-\ncising the non-injured side can reduce atrophy in the injured side. Dumbbells are a perfect tool for one-sided work\nand the number of repetitions can increase in cases where the loading is limited. However, this should not be the\nonly option for someone with an injured limb. If an exercise involves two movement functions, an athlete may stil\nbe able to perform one with both sides. For example, in a thruster, an athlete with an injured upper body might stil\nbe able to squat or front squat. If the athlete has an injured lower body, he or she might still be able to press or push\npress. If there are no reasonable options for an injured person to perform a similar movement, omit the movement\nor substitute something else. This should be the last option considered.\nUsing the workout Amanda as an example, scaling options for injured athletes would take on many different forms\ndepending on the injury. Here are a couple of examples:\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s shoulder is injured such that he or she cannot support any load with one arm.\nPotentially, the snatch becomes a heavy dumbbell snatch on the good side, or it could become a 135-lb.\nback squat; the load could even be increased to be more challenging in the 9-7-5 repetition scheme. The\nmuscle-up may become a single-arm ring row and push-up or dumbbell press.\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s knee is injured such that he or she has limited flexion. The snatch may become a\nsnatch variation (power, muscle, hang) depending on the range of motion of the knee. The muscle-up\nwould not have to be scaled.\nWhen the injured side is cleared to be used again, the trainer must increase intensity very gradually, with a heavy\nemphasis on maintaining optimal mechanics to prevent additional injuries.\nImplementing scaling in a class environment\nAfter a trainer has analyzed the workout and knows what is likely to need scaling (especially movement substitutions)\ndirection must be given to the entire class to help each individual to the appropriate modification. While this can be\ndifficult in a busy class setting, a lot of scaling confusion can be prevented when the trainer introduces the workout\nto the class by indicating the intended stimulus or goal of the workout. Loading, repetition, time, and movement\nconsiderations can be discussed.\nPresenting several scaling options at this time can help keep the class moving. Some gyms present set scaling options\nthat keep large groups organized. This is fine, but a trainer must also recognize that the best choice for some athletes\nmay be an entirely different option. An experienced trainer should have no problem creating unique scaling options\nas necessary without taking away from class instruction and group cohesion.\nThe trainer also needs to observe clients as they increase loads and practice the movements in preparation for the\nworkout. An effective trainer can quickly see if the movement loading and repetition scheme chosen for the workout\nare appropriate by watching warm-up sets. There are times when scaling may have been assessed incorrectly and\na trainer needs to scale after the workout has begun. If an athlete is struggling too early in the workout and will not\nachieve the desired outcome, the trainer needs to adjust one or more of the workout variables mid-workout (e.g.\nload, repetitions). This is mandatory if an athlete cannot maintain safe mechanics. In these instances, it is important\nthat the trainer is firm with his or her decision. If he or she has built a good rapport with athletes, they should have\nno problem with such adjustments."}
{"294": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nSport-specific preparation\nMany CrossFit trainers have some sport-specific athletes looking to incorporate CrossFit training into their regimen\nWhile sport-specific athletes cannot use CrossFit as a substitute for their sport-specific practice, fixing deficiencies in\ntheir general physical preparedness has immediate benefit within their sport. These carry-over benefits may not have\nobvious mechanical or metabolic explanations. For specialists at the advanced tier of their sport, there is a greater\nmargin to improve their performance by improving their general physical preparedness versus spending more time\nin sport-specific strength and conditioning training. Sport training and physiology are not so well understood that\nhighly specialized strength and conditioning routines are optimally effective, and CrossFit brings a com bination of\nadaptations that lead to improved performance.\nA CrossFit trainer needs to remember that he or she coaches CrossFit and should not attempt to mimic the sport\nwithin CrossFit workouts. A CrossFit trainer is not the athlete\u2019s swim, soccer, or tennis coach and should not attempt\nto coach beyond his or her knowledge. Doing so results in a trainer giving poor CrossFit training and poor sport-spe-\ncific training. The CrossFit trainer needs to program CrossFit for these sport-specific athletes, just as for their non-\nsport-specific clients. The sport practices and sport coaches will improve the specific skills needed on the field, in\na match, etc.\nCrossFit trainers need to be mindful of their athletes\u2019 competition seasons to be sure the volume of CrossFit is helping\nand not hurting an athlete\u2019s sport performance. CrossFit training is secondary to the sport training, particularly in\nseason. There is often a natural trade-off in volume between CrossFit and the sport training depending on the time of\nyear relative to the in-season period. This is to allow more time and energy for competition when seasonal demands\nare higher. This may not be necessary for all athletes in all sports. The general guideline is to add CrossFit volume\ncautiously while constantly assessing sport performance and being particularly cautious when an athlete is near in\ntime to an important event.\nPrograMMing ConsideraTions: CoMMon PiTfaLLs\nIf a programmer regularly assesses his or her athletes and observes the trends in data, he or she can quickly adjust\nineffective programming. Conversely, CrossFit programmers who do not regularly assess data can fall prey to\ncommon faults, some of which are described below.\n1. The first common error made by CrossFit programmers is a lack of regular assessment to determine\neffectiveness. Measurable results in performance markers are the guideposts for a programmer to\ndetermine whether the past programming was productive as well as what needs to be programmed next\nLack of assessment may occur from not repeating benchmark workouts and/or not recording results\nTrainers need to encourage members to record results to assist with this effort. Clients generally like this\nrecord of progress, particularly after months and years of hard work.\n2. Another error for CrossFit programmers occurs when variance is not applied correctly, and this is usually\nexpressed in one of three ways: randomization of workout variables, biasing certain variables, or emphasizing\nnon-essential elements. As mentioned above, optimal variance of workout variables requires intentiona\nplanning, not merely spinning the hopper and pulling out random tasks. A hopper may be used as a good\ntest of fitness (i.e., is an athlete ready for anything?), but it is not a good method to prepare for everything\nReliance on the hopper would leave to chance the broad, general, and inclusive adaptations CrossFit is"}
{"295": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\ntrying to develop. Programming via a hopper may be fun once in a while and can be used occasionally in\ncompetitions, but it is not a method by which to program for the best results.\nBiasing occurs when certain elements or combinations are repeated too often, with some elements avoided\ncompletely. There is nothing inherently bad about biasing as long as that is the intended goal. Biasing is a prob-\nlem if the goal is to develop general physical preparedness.\nAnother misapplication of variance is emphasizing non-essential elements. This appears as an endless\ncombination of workout variables, regardless of their utility or effect. For example, never repeating work-\nouts, performing lots of accessory or skill movements in actual workouts (e.g., Sots presses, single-leg work\nsport-specific drills), or focusing too much on environmental factors (e.g., working out with a gas mask or in the\nmiddle of the night) can be signs that variance is being misapplied. It can be easy for newer programmers to\nbelieve \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d programming provides a superior stimulus because of the novelty.\n3. A third common error in CrossFit programming is a lack of higher-skill development. This can occur when\ncertain movements are avoided in workouts or when warm-ups are not used to address weaknesses. A\ncurrent trend within the community is to avoid the more difficult gymnastics movements. CrossFit athletes\nare willing to tackle the technical weightlifting movements such as the snatch and clean and jerk but do not\nspend as much time developing the more technical counterparts in gymnastics, such as levers, planches\npresses to handstands, or pirouettes.\n4. CrossFit programmers may be tempted to use excessive volume. This occurs with more than one training\nsession a day (i.e., double days). In some cases, athletes may even attempt more than two sessions. This\npitfall affects those trying to emulate the volume sometimes used by CrossFit Games athletes. Games\nathletes\u2019 training is not representative of what CrossFit programming should look like. Multiple sessions a\nday are not appropriate for 99 percent of CrossFit athletes (less than one percent of those who participate\nin the Open go to the Games). Even multiple workouts in one extended \u201csession\u201d should generally be\navoided. Extra sessions and/or extra workouts may help performance in the short term but often lead to\novertraining, higher risk of injury, and burnout in the long term. Double days help Games athletes prepare\nfor high-volume competition and can help them get in more volume so they can advance certain skills\nrelative to their competitors. Generally, however, there is actually a decrease in intensity across sessions. As\nCoach Glassman said, \u201cBe impressed by intensity, not volume.\u201d If a client is looking to be competitive, very\ngradually and cautiously increase volume. For example, start with additional skill sessions (e.g., double-\nunder practice) in areas in which the athlete is not as proficient, not multiple workouts. Look at CrossFit\ncom and assess what the athlete cannot complete, then add \u201cvolume\u201d by way of working on these skills. The\nvolume should gradually increase over the long term.\n5. Another trickle-down effect from the Games is the assumption that the \u201cCrossFit standard\u201d for a movement\nis what is performed at the CrossFit Games. Standards in competition are set for ease of judging and do\nnot necessarily represent the best expression of the movement. They are used to establish the minimum\nrequirements for a repetition, and an athlete is held to those standards to ensure the range of motion is\nthe same across all competitors. Take, for example, hand-release push-ups: There is nothing better about\nthem in terms of muscular development or mechanical advantage. They are used because they are easier"}
{"296": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nto judge; a judge can easily ensure the chest and thighs make contact with the ground on every single\nrepetition. Standards in competitions should not prevent an athlete from using (or a trainer from teaching)\nmany different movement mechanics to develop a broad athletic capacity. There are different adaptations\nto all movements, and variations at the very least improve the overall coordination of an athlete who can\naccomplish a single task in multiple ways. CrossFit encourages athletes to learn all possible techniques and\nnot a single \u201cstandard\u201d (e.g., strict, chest-to-bar, kipping, and butterfly kipping pull-ups). This is another face\nof variance needed to develop the athletic capacity to accomplish tasks in multiple ways, and it is what wil\nbest prepare one for any test of fitness.\nConCLusion\nEffective programming occurs by applying basic tenets when selecting workout elements and combinations\nOptimizing long-term program design is best guided by observing results (i.e., objective and measurable change\nin performance markers) and applying focused weakness work or appropriate scaling. The elements of the daily\nworkouts are but one factor that affects how well an individual optimizes his or her fitness.

{"303": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nCLASS STRUCTURE AND LESSON PLANNING\nDuring the Level 2 Course, participants are led through a mock class from start to finish. It is meant to serve as a basic\nclass template for CrossFit affiliates. Although each example class at the Level 2 course is different\u2014from instructors\nto warm-up drills to workouts\u2014universally, there are themes that represent effective coaching practices.\nBeing a trainer is not about showing up, quickly writing a last-minute workout at the whiteboard, and turning on the\nmusic. Real training is about improving each client\u2019s fitness (and by association quality of life) in small, incremental\nsteps in a motivating and positive way. Besides having the presence, attitude, and demonstration skills to develop a\npositive rapport with one\u2019s clients (see \u201cFoundations of Effective Training\u201d), a large part of improving client fitness is\nhaving a plan, both on a day-to-day and long-term basis. This section discusses the basic but necessary components\na trainer needs to run a single class.\nTo effectively manage time, trainers need to have a lesson plan. A single class can be outlined as a four-part lesson\nplan consisting of:\n\u2022 Introduction\n\u2022 Warm-Up\n\u2022 Workout\n\u2022 Post-Workout\nThe total time of the workout helps set the allotted time for the warm-up and cool-down sections. A longer workout\nmeans sacrificing time in either or both. Most affiliates run hour-long classes, and this is the length used in the Level\n2 example class.\nLogistical considerations affect an appropriate workout to select, as well as the time allotted to each component of\nthe class. Factors include gear availability, class size, gym space (for equipment and athlete layout), and the expe-\nrience level of the class. A trainer needs to consider various alternatives because additional modifications may be\nnecessary on the fly, depending on the experience level of the clients and how many show up. For example, if the\naffiliate has limited floor space, it will not take many participants to make it cramped. For safety considerations, a\ntrainer needs to ensure there are walkable areas between all moving athletes and their equipment. Dumbbells are\na phenomenal tool for athletes; they are great space savers, as well as substitutes for barbells in many scenarios.\nTrainers may also use sandbags, the outdoors, staggered heats, etc. Trainers are limited only by their knowledge\nand creativity.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction, although the shortest element of a class, is of great importance. During the introduction\n(commonly referred to as the time \u201cat the whiteboard\u201d), the coach will brief the workout, set expectations by explain-\ning the intended stimulus, offer several scaling options, and take any questions. Generally, the introduction will take\nbetween two and four minutes, depending on the complexity of the workout and the number of participants taking\nclass. Having more participants increases the likelihood of questions. The introduction should serve to clear up any\nconfusion about the workout while also reducing pre-workout anxiety."}
{"304": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nWarm-up\nThe purpose of the warm-up is to do just that: warm the body in preparation for intense activity. Warm-ups often\nconsist of two parts: a general warm-up and a specific warm-up. The main goal of a general warm-up is to stimulate\nthe body\u2019s physiological functions\u2014i.e., increase core temperature and blood flow to the muscles, prime the car-\ndiorespiratory system, increase mobility, and move joints through a full range of motion. General warm-ups usually\ninclude calisthenic-type movements or movements that involve dynamic ranges of motion.\nThe primary goals of a specific warm-up are to build, practice, and refine proper mechanics for the movements that\nwill be used in the workout, and to prepare mentally and physically for the challenge. Specific warm-ups present an\nopportunity for movement assessment and appropriate scaling. However, potentially different ranges of motion\nand/or variations may be used (e.g., power vs. squat variations, medicine balls vs. barbells) where necessary.\nMovements that are not part of the workout may also be used in the warm-up, as the warm-up element also provides\nan opportunity to improve deficiencies in any movements (i.e., practicing handstands even though handstands may\nnot be in the workout). Typically, these options are reserved for shorter, lower-skill workouts that do not require a\nsignificant amount of time to prepare for (i.e., rowing 1,000 meters for time or running a timed mile). The \u201cProgram\nDesign and Scaling\u201d article discusses how to use this time as focused weakness work.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and coach in the warm-up period. The warm-up helps athletes best prepare\nto handle the demands of the workout and improve upon deficiencies, whether they are subtle mechanical ineffi-\nciencies in more experienced athletes or larger faults in movements with which athletes have little experience. The\nwarm-up also provides the trainer with an opportunity to assess the athletic capacity of an individual relative to\nthe intended stimulus. Following the assessment/practice period, it is time for the trainer to assign scaling options\nAlthough the trainer should have some ideas before starting a class, it isn\u2019t until after actually assessing athletes\nneeds that a trainer can choose the most effective option(s). As discussed in the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article\nscaling should progress with the athletes, and they should be constantly challenged (i.e., they should not just perform\nthe same scale every time a movement, rep range, or prescribed load is outside their current capacity). Beyond\nassessment and scaling, the warm-up is also the time for the coach to mentally prepare the athletes and oversee any\nremaining workout logistics (e.g., equipment distribution, equipment layout, heats, safety checks).\nA pre-workout break is not one of the main elements of a lesson plan, but it is needed and useful for a coach. The\npre-workout break includes safety and equipment checks, room layout, workout flow, additional scaling, questions\nfrom the athletes, a bathroom opportunity, and of course, the workout re-brief.\nThe workout re-brief is there to remind the athletes what the workout is (order of movements, repetition scheme\nand rounds or time) and the range-of-motion standards that are required. A coach needs to clearly demonstrate and\nemphasize the range of motion and mechanics for every movement before every single workout. This makes it easier\nto hold athletes to these standards during the workout and cultivate a culture of virtuosity in one\u2019s gym.\nWe must remember, especially for newer athletes, workout abbreviations and acronyms on the whiteboard are not\nself-evident. A coach may choose to discuss scaling options with the entire class at this time or even review the\nintended stimulus of the workout. This could potentially include describing the targeted time domain, loading, or skil\nacquisition. For example, the workout Elizabeth (21-15-9 repetitions of cleans at 135 lb. and ring dips) is a relatively\nshort workout (about 5 min.), with moderate loading. Novice CrossFit athletes likely have to reduce the load for the"}
{"305": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nclean to their level of moderate loading (e.g., 95 lb.), and they might have to address the dips\u2019 load (e.g., band, bench)\nor volume (e.g., 12-9-6) to best match the original workout intent. See the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article for\nmore information about preserving the intended stimulus.\nWhether in the pre-workout brief or the specific warm-up, time should be allotted for athletes to practice the exact\nstandards to be used in the workout. If the movement is loaded, additional time is needed for athletes to work up to\nan appropriate load under the discretion of the trainer.\nWorkout\nOnce the workout begins, the demands on a coach\u2019s abilities increase. Coaching is not about repetition counting\ncheering, or selecting music. It is about appropriately applying threshold training, which means pushing an athlete\u2019s\nintensity while maintaining sound mechanics. This balance is what helps minimize the risk for injury but also keeps\nthe intensity high to drive progress. Deviations in mechanics are inevitable as athletes try to move fast to complete\nthe workout. A coach must attend to each client, using as many different cueing strategies as possible or needed\nand offering encouragement and reinforcement of sound mechanics throughout the workout. A coach may find that\nhe or she actually has to slow an athlete down and/or lower the load, as well as potentially stop them, if there is no\nimprovement in mechanics across multiple repetitions. Movement change is not reserved only for the warm-up. It\nmust continue throughout the workout. A coach is expected to make athletes better during the workout.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and the coach during the workout. The athlete will receive increased fitness\nadaptations from appropriately increasing speed and load. In addition, he or she should be receiving feedback from\nthe coach on how to improve and refine movement. The coach benefits in this scenario by learning and developing\nseeing and correcting skills in a faster, more dynamic, and less-controlled environment. The ability to deliver action-\nable and effective cues for better movement improves with experience while coaching under high intensity. It is a\npractical, real-time learning opportunity that is focused on effective coaching strategies related to both the athlete\u2019s\nmechanics and motivation.\nPost-workout\nThe main purpose of the post-workout element is to cool down the athletes and program items that will aid in\nrecovery, regaining mental acuity, slowing heart rates and breathing, and facilitating full range of motion about the\njoints (i.e., regaining homeostasis). The coach may also have some secondary goals for this period, such as additiona\nskill work, fitness challenges, education for the athlete, and preparation of the space for the next class. Regardless\na well-conducted post-workout session must include a proper cool-down that leaves clients prepared for the rest of\ntheir day, capable and eager to return and full of appreciation for their accomplishments.\nSome examples of possible cool-down elements are described below. Generally, the cool-down should begin by just\nallowing the athletes to recover for a few minutes. While the athletes are warm and pliable, the cool-down is an excel-\nlent time to stretch or foam roll, especially the areas that were taxed heavily. This can aid recovery, reducing soreness\nwhile potentially helping athletes to gain new range of motion. A coach may leave this as an open period, allowing\nmembers to choose which drills are best for them. A coach-led session, however, ensures everyone has direction\nattention, motivation, and a sense of togetherness.\nA trainer may choose to include skill work at the end of a workout. This can include a review of the movements\nused, especially to correct errors that may have presented themselves during the workout. Using reduced speed and"}
{"306": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nload, the trainer can reinforce sound movement mechanics before the athlete leaves. If a trainer filmed an athlete\u2019s\nmovement during the workout, this period can include video playback to review his or her technique. It is also possible\nto work on a totally unrelated skill. While practice is more difficult after a workout due to fatigue, this is precisely why\nattempting new skills here can be beneficial (heightened neurological adaptations due to muscular fatigue).\nA post-workout may include a finisher\u2014an impromptu fitness test such as a maximum set of pull-ups, handstand\nwalking, or rope climbs\u2014anything. It can be part of an ongoing record or a competition, and it can be used as a moti-\nvational event or a chance to reinforce the unknown and unknowable nature of life\u2019s challenges. For example, finish-\ners may be grouped into teams or partners, or the challenge may be structured so one or two athletes compete at a\ntime and the rest of the class can cheer. As in a warm-up, a coach needs to be mindful that finishers do not become\na second workout, nor do they have to be part of every class.\nA coach can use the post-workout period to ensure athletes are recording their workouts. Especially on benchmark\ndays (including strength days), the coach should encourage members to write down their times, repetitions, loads\nand scaling or modifications. The coach should also be able to tell the members the last date the workout was com-\npleted for comparison.\nFinally, a coach can use this time as an educational opportunity to talk about nutrition, programming, scaling, \u201cWhat\nIs Fitness?\u201d or \u201cWhat is CrossFit?\u201d etc., all with the intention of creating smarter athletes.\nThe post-workout/cool-down period gives the coach time to survey athletes and look for mental faculties and visible\nsigns of injury or physical distress. A coach needs to pay attention to verbal and nonverbal cues that an athlete may\nbe under duress. This is also a time for the coach to engage in conversation with athletes by offering encouragement\nand feedback on performance and asking about their physical responses to the workout. Such conversations provide\nvaluable information about the coach\u2019s or facility\u2019s programming. These small connections also lay the groundwork\nfor building a strong community and meaningful relationships with one\u2019s members. The post-workout period is an\noften overlooked or rushed section of class, but it is valuable time, and a coach should use it wisely.\nTo be effective in each class, not only does a coach have to have capacity in all six areas discussed in the \u201cFoundations\nof Effective Training\u201d article, but one must also have a plan. This plan covers all aspects of the class to best improve\none\u2019s athletes with each training session while keeping them safe and excited to return for the next day. After each\nsession, an informal review and critique of one\u2019s own class performance can help the coach better prepare for sub-\nsequent sessions. Self-awareness and critique are critical to development.\nExample lesson plans and scaling options for two workouts are presented on the following pages."}

{"4": "UNDERSTANDING CROSSFIT\nOriginally published in April 2007.\nThe aims, prescription, methodology, implementation, and adaptations of Cross-\nFit are collectively and individually unique, defining of CrossFit, and instrumental\nin our program\u2019s successes in diverse applications.\nAIMS\nFrom the beginning, the aim of CrossFit has been to forge a broad, general, and in-\nclusive fitness. We sought to build a program that would best prepare trainees for\nany physical contingency\u2014prepare them not only for the unknown but for the un-\nknowable. Looking at all sport and physical tasks collectively, we asked what physi-\ncal skills and adaptations would most universally lend themselves to performance\nadvantage. Capacity culled from the intersection of all sports demands would\nquite logically lend itself well to all sport. In sum, our specialty is not specializing.\nPRESCRIPTION\nCrossFit is: \u201cconstantly varied, high-intensity functional movement.\u201d This is our\nprescription. Functional movements are universal motor recruitment patterns;\nthey are performed in a wave of contraction from core to extremity; and they are\ncompound movements\u2014i.e., they are multi-joint. They are natural, effective, and\nefficient locomotors of body and external objects. But no aspect of functional\nmovements is more important than their capacity to move large loads over long\ndistances, and to do so quickly. Collectively, these three attributes (load, distance,\nand speed) uniquely qualify functional movements for the production of high pow-\ner. Intensity is defined exactly as power, and intensity is the independent variable\nmost commonly associated with maximizing the rate of return of favorable adap-\ntation to exercise. Recognizing that the breadth and depth of a program\u2019s stimulus\nwill determine the breadth and depth of the adaptation it elicits, our prescription\nof functionality and intensity is constantly varied. We believe that preparation for\nrandom physical challenges\u2014i.e., unknown and unknowable events\u2014is at odds\nwith fixed, predictable, and routine regimens."}
{"5": "METHODOLOGY\nThe methodology that drives CrossFit is entirely empirical. We believe that mean-\ningful statements about safety, efficacy, and efficiency, the three most important\nand interdependent facets to evaluate any fitness program, can be supported only\nby measurable, observable, repeatable data. We call this approach \u201cevidence-based\nfitness.\u201d CrossFit\u2019s methodology depends on full disclosure of methods, results,\nand criticisms, and we have employed the internet to support these values. Our\ncharter is open source, making co-developers out of participating coaches, ath-\nletes, and trainers through a spontaneous and collaborative online community.\nCrossFit is empirically driven, clinically tested, and community developed.\nIMPLEMENTATION We\u2019ve take\nIn implementation, CrossFit is, quite simply, a sport\u2014the Sport of Fitness.

{"8": "Aside from the breadth or totality of fitness CrossFit seeks, our program is dis-\ntinctive, if not unique, in its focus on maximizing neuroendocrine response, de-\nveloping power, cross-training with multiple training modalities, constant training\nand practice with functional movements, and the development of successful\ndiet strategies.\nOur athletes are trained to bike, run, swim, and row at short, middle, and long\ndistances, guaranteeing exposure and competency in each of the three main met-\nabolic pathways.\nWe train our athletes in gymnastics from rudimentary to advanced movements,\ngarnering great capacity at controlling the body both dynamically and statically\nwhile maximizing strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility. We also place a heavy\nemphasis on Olympic weightlifting, having seen this sport\u2019s unique ability to devel-\nop an athlete\u2019s explosive power, control of external objects, and mastery of critical\nmotor recruitment patterns. And finally we encourage and assist our athletes to\nexplore a variety of sports as a vehicle to express and apply their fitness.\nAN EFFECTIVE APPROACH\nIn gyms and health clubs throughout the world the typical workout consists of\nisolation movements and extended aerobic sessions. The fitness community from\ntrainers to the magazines has the exercising public believing that lateral raises,\ncurls, leg extensions, sit-ups and the like combined with 20- to 40-minute stints on\nthe stationary bike or treadmill are going to lead to some kind of great fitness. Well,\nat CrossFit we work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high-in-\ntensity cardiovascular sessions. We have replaced the lateral raise with the push\npress, the curl with the pull-up, and the leg extension with the squat. For every\nlong-distance effort our athletes will do five or six at short distance. Why? Because\nfunctional movements and high intensity are radically more effective at eliciting\nnearly any desired fitness result. Startlingly, this is not a matter of opinion but\nsolid, irrefutable scientific fact, and yet the marginally effective old ways persist\nand are nearly universal. Our approach is consistent with what is practiced in elite"}
{"9": "training programs associated with major university athletic teams and profession-\nal sports. CrossFit endeavors to bring state-of-the-art coaching techniques to the\ngeneral public and athlete.\nIS THIS FOR ME?\nAbsolutely! Your needs and the Olympic athlete\u2019s differ by degree not kind. In-\ncreased power, speed, strength, cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, flexibility,\nstamina, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy are each important to the\nworld\u2019s best athletes and to our grandparents. The amazing truth is that the very\nsame methods that elicit optimal response in the Olympic or professional athlete\nwill optimize the same response in the elderly. Of course, we cannot load your\ngrandmother with the same squatting weight that we would assign an Olympic\nskier, but they both need to squat. In fact, squatting is essential to maintaining\nfunctional independence and improving fitness. Squatting is just one example\nof a movement that is universally valuable and essential yet rarely taught to any\nbut the most advanced of athletes. This is a tragedy. Through painstakingly thor-\nough coaching and incremental load assignment, CrossFit has been able to teach\neveryone who can care for himself or herself to perform safe-\nly and with maximum efficacy the same movements typically\nutilized by professional coaches in elite and certainly exclusive\nenvironments.\nWHO HAS BENEFITED FROM CROSSFIT?\nMany professional and elite athletes are participating in CrossFit.\nPrizefighters, cyclists, surfers, skiers, tennis players, triathletes\nand others competing at the highest levels are using CrossFit to\nadvance their core strength and conditioning, but that is not all.\nCrossFit has tested its methods on the sedentary, overweight,\npathological, and elderly and found that these special popula-\ntions met the same success as our stable of athletes. We call this\n\u201cbracketing.\u201d If our program works for Olympic skiers and over-\nweight, sedentary homemakers then it will work for you."}
{"10": "JUST WHAT IS A \u201cCORE STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING\u201d PROGRAM?\nCrossFit is a core strength and conditioning program in two distinct senses. First,\nwe are a core strength and conditioning program in the sense that the fitness\nwe develop is foundational to all other athletic\nneeds. This is the same sense in which the uni-\nversity courses required of a particular major\nare called the \u201ccore curriculum.\u201d This is the stuff\nthat everyone needs. Second, we are a \u201ccore\u201d\nstrength and conditioning program in the literal\nsense meaning the center of something. Much\nof our work focuses on the major functional axis\nof the human body, the extension and flexion\nof the hips and torso or trunk. The primacy of\ncore strength and conditioning in this sense is\nsupported by the simple observation that pow-\nerful hip extension alone is necessary and near-\nly sufficient for elite athletic performance. That\nis, our experience has been that no one without\nthe capacity for powerful hip extension enjoys\ngreat athletic prowess and nearly everyone we\nhave met with that capacity was a great athlete.\nRunning, jumping, punching, and throwing all\noriginate at the core. At CrossFit we endeavor\nto develop our athletes from the inside out, from core to extremity, which is, by\nthe way, how good functional movements recruit muscle, from the core to the\nextremities.\nCAN I ENJOY OPTIMAL HEALTH WITHOUT BEING AN ATHLETE?\nNo! Athletes experience a protection from the ravages of aging and disease that\nnon-athletes never find. For instance, 80-year-old athletes are stronger than\nnon-athletes in their prime at 25 years old. If you think that strength is not import-\nant, consider that strength loss is what puts people in nursing homes. Athletes\nhave greater bone density, stronger immune systems, less coronary heart dis-"}
{"11": "WHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO BE AN ATHLETE; I JUST WANT TO BE HEALTHY?\nYou are in luck. We hear this often, but the truth is that fitness, wellness, and pa-\nthology (sickness) are measures of the same entity: your health. There are a mul-\ntitude of measurable parameters that can be ordered from sick (pathological) to\nwell (normal) to fit (better than normal). These include but are not limited to blood\npressure, cholesterol, heart rate, body fat, muscle mass, flexibility, and strength.\nIt seems as though all of the body functions that can go awry have states that are\npathological, normal, and exceptional and that elite athletes typically show these\nparameters in the exceptional range. CrossFit\u2019s view is that fitness and health are\nthe same thing (see \u201cWhat Is Fitness? (Part 1)\u201d article). It is also interesting to notice\nthat the health professional maintains your health with drugs and surgery, each\nwith potentially undesirable side effects, whereas the CrossFit trainer typically\nachieves a superior result always with \u201cside benefit\u201d versus side effect.\nEXAMPLES OF CROSSFIT EXERCISES\nBiking, running, swimming, and rowing in an endless variety of drills. The clean and\njerk, snatch, squat, deadlift, push press, bench press, and power clean. Jumping,\nmedicine-ball throws and catches, pull-ups, dips, push-ups, handstands, presses\nto handstands, pirouettes, kips, cartwheels, muscle-ups, sit-ups, scales, and holds.\nWe make regular use of bikes, the track, rowing shells and ergometers, Olympic\nweight sets, rings, parallel bars, free exercise mats, horizontal bars, plyometrics\nboxes, medicine balls, and jump ropes.\nThere is not a strength and conditioning program anywhere that works with a\ngreater diversity of tools, modalities, and drills.\nWHAT IF I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF THIS?\nIt is a common sentiment to feel that because of the obligations of career and fami-\nly that you do not have the time to become as fit as you might like. Here is the good\nnews: World-class age group strength and conditioning is obtainable through an\nhour a day six days per week of training. It turns out that the intensity of training\nthat optimizes physical conditioning is not sustainable past 45 minutes to an hour.\nAthletes who train for hours a day are developing skill or training for sports that in-"}
{"12": "physical skills (cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, flexibility, strength,\npower, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy). The excessive aero-\nbic volume of the endurance athletes\u2019 training costs them in speed, power, and\nstrength to the point that their athletic competency has been compromised. No\ntriathlete is in ideal shape to wrestle, box, pole-vault, sprint, play any ball sport,\nfight fires, or do police work. Each of these requires a fitness level far beyond the\nneeds of the endurance athlete. None of this suggests that being a marathoner,\ntriathlete or other endurance athlete is a bad thing; just do not believe that training\nas a long-distance athlete gives you the fitness that is prerequisite to many sports.\nCrossFit considers the sumo wrestler, triathlete, marathoner, and powerlifter to\nbe \u201cfringe athletes\u201d in that their fitness demands are so specialized as to be incon-\nsistent with the adaptations that give maximum competency at all physical chal-\nlenges. Elite strength and conditioning is a compromise between each of the 10\nphysical adaptations. Endurance athletes do not balance that compromise.\nAEROBICS AND ANAEROBICS\nThere are three main energy systems that fuel all human activity. Almost all chang-\nes that occur in the body due to exercise are related to the demands placed on\nthese energy systems. Furthermore, the efficacy of any given fitness regimen may\nlargely be tied to its ability to elicit an adequate stimulus for change within these\nthree energy systems.\nEnergy is derived aerobically when oxygen is utilized to metabolize substrates de-\nrived from food and liberates energy. An activity is termed aerobic when the ma-\njority of energy needed is derived aerobically. These activities are usually greater\nthan 90 seconds in duration and involve low to moderate power output or inten-\nsity. Examples of aerobic activity include running on the treadmill for 20 minutes,\nswimming a mile, and watching TV.\nEnergy is derived anaerobically when energy is liberated from substrates in the\nabsence of oxygen. Activities are considered anaerobic when the majority of the\nenergy needed is derived anaerobically. In fact, properly structured, anaerobic ac-\ntivity can be used to develop a very high level of aerobic fitness without the muscle"}
{"13": "It warrants mention that in any activity all three energy systems are utilized\nthough one may dominate. The interplay of these systems can be complex, yet a\nsimple examination of the characteristics of aerobic versus anaerobic training can\nprove useful.\nCrossFit\u2019s approach is to judiciously balance anaerobic and aerobic exercise in a\nmanner that is consistent with the athlete\u2019s goals. Our exercise prescriptions ad-\nhere to proper specificity, progression, variation, and recovery to optimize\nadaptations.\nTHE OLYMPIC LIFTS, A.K.A., WEIGHTLIFTING\nThere are two Olympic lifts, the clean and jerk and\nthe snatch. Mastery of these lifts develops the\nsquat, deadlift, power clean, and split jerk while\nintegrating them into a single movement of un-\nequaled value in all of strength and conditioning.\nThe Olympic lifters are without a doubt the world\u2019s\nstrongest athletes.\nThese lifts train athletes to effectively activate more\nmuscle fibers more rapidly than through any other\nmodality of training. The explosiveness that results\nfrom this training is of vital necessity to every sport.\nPracticing the Olympic lifts teaches one to apply\nforce to muscle groups in proper sequence; i.e.,\nfrom the center of the body to its extremities (core\nto extremity). Learning this vital technical lesson benefits all athletes who need\nto impart force to another person or object, as is commonly required in near-\nly all sports.\nIn addition to learning to impart explosive forces, the clean and jerk and snatch\ncondition the body to receive such forces from another moving body both safely"}
{"14": "GYMNASTICS\nThe extraordinary value of gymnastics as a training modality lies in its reliance on\nthe body\u2019s own weight as the sole source of resistance. This places a unique premi-\num on the improvement of strength-to-weight ratio. Unlike other strength training\nmodalities, gymnastics and calisthenics allow for increases in strength only while\nincreasing strength-to-weight ratio!\nGymnastics develops pull-ups, squats, lunges, jumping, push-ups, and numerous\npresses to handstand, scales, and holds. These skills are unrivaled in their benefit\nto the physique, as evident in any competitive gymnast.\nAs important as the capacity of this modality is for strength development, it is with-\nout a doubt the ultimate approach to improving coordination, balance, agility, ac-\ncuracy, and flexibility. Through the use of numerous presses, handstands, scales,\nand other floor work, the gymnast\u2019s training greatly enhances kinesthetic sense.\nThe variety of movements available for inclusion in this modality probably exceeds\nthe number of exercises known to all non-gymnastic sport! The rich variety here\ncontributes substantially to CrossFit\u2019s ability to inspire great athletic confidence\nand prowess.\nFor a combination of strength, flexibility, well-developed physique, coordina-\ntion, balance, accuracy, and agility, the gymnast has no equal in the sports world.\nThe inclusion of this training modality is absurdly absent from nearly all train-\ning programs.\nROUTINES\nThere is no ideal routine! In fact, the chief value of any routine lies in abandon-\ning it for another. The CrossFit ideal is to train for any contingency. The obvious\nimplication is that this is possible only if there is a tremendously varied quality to\nthe breadth of stimulus. It is in this sense that CrossFit is a core strength and con-\nditioning program. Anything else is sport-specific training, not core strength and\nconditioning."}

{"18": "WHAT SHOULD I EAT?\nIn plain language, base your diet on garden vegetables (especially greens), meats,\nnuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar. That is about as simple as we\ncan get. Many have observed that keeping your grocery cart to the perimeter of the\ngrocery store while avoiding the aisles is a great way to protect your health.

The caveman model is perfect-\nly consistent with CrossFit\u2019s prescription.\nWHAT FOODS SHOULD I AVOID?\nExcessive consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates is the primary culprit in\nnutritionally caused health problems. High-glycemic carbohydrates are those that\nraise blood sugar too rapidly. They include rice, bread, candy, potato, sweets, so-\ndas, and most processed carbohydrates. Processing can include bleaching, bak-\ning, grinding, and refining. Processing of carbohydrates greatly increases their\nglycemic index, a measure of their propensity to elevate blood sugar.\nWHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH HIGH-GLYCEMIC CARBOHYDRATES?\nThe problem with high-glycemic carbohydrates is that in excess they give an inor-\ndinate insulin response.

Sport is the application of fitness in a fan-\ntastic atmosphere of competition and mastery.

It is, after all, the com-\nbined expression, or application, of the 10 general skills that is our motivation for\ntheir development in the first place. Sports and games like soccer, martial arts,\nbaseball, and basketball, in contrast to our training workouts, have more varied\nand less predictable movements. But, where sports develop and require all 10\ngeneral skills simultaneously, they do so slowly compared to our strength and con-\nditioning regimen. Sport is better, in our view, at expression and testing of skills\nthan it is at developing these same skills. Both expression and development are\ncrucial to our fitness.

They gave rea-\nsonable definitions to each of these 10 so that they seemed fairly distinct. Keep\nin mind, however, nature has no obligation to recognize these distinctions.

{"36": "We have countless examples of this from amateur and professional sports. At the\nheart of this is that we have learned some things about GPP that the world never\nknew before. There is more opportunity of advancing athletic performance via\nadvancing GPP than there is in more sport-specific strength and conditioning\ntraining. For example, I am not sure why more pull-ups make for better skiers,\nbut they do. We have some theories why that occurs, but we do not actually need\nto know the mechanism. We are focused on advancing performance.\nSo the second model is a statistical model using skills and drills. I am looking for a\nbalance of capacity across training modalities.\nThe third model uses the three metabolic pathways. These are the three engines\nthat produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the currency of effort of all energy\noutput. Power is plotted on the Y-axis and duration of effort (time) on the X-axis.\nThe first pathway (phosphagen or phosphocreatine) is high powered and short\nduration. It can account for about 100 percent of max human output and taps out\nat about 10 seconds. The second pathway (lactate or glycolytic) is moderate pow-\nered, moderate duration. It accounts for approximately 70 percent of max pow-\ner output, peaks at about 60 seconds and terminates at 120 seconds. The third\npathway (oxidative or aerobic) is low powered, long duration. It accounts for ap-\nproximately 40 percent of max power output and does not fade in any reasonable\ntime for which I have the patience to measure. The phosphagen and the glycolytic\npathways are anaerobic; oxidative is aerobic. All three engines work all the time to\nsome extent. The degree to which each is active is dependent on the activity. One\nidles, while the other two rev; two will rev, one will idle, etc.\nOur thought is this: He or she is as fit as he or she is balanced in capacity in all\nthree of these engines. A human being is a vehicle with three engines. Suppose we\ndiscover there is a fourth engine; we want capacity there, too. We develop capacity\nin all engines through our prescription: constantly varied functional movement\nexecuted at high intensity.

Then go back to the thrusters\nfor 15 repetitions, 15 pull-ups, 9 of each, stop the clock, and we get a total time\nfor the effort.\nPower is force times distance (work) divided by time. The work required to do Fran\nis constant (force times distance). It does not change unless your height changes\n(distance), the distance we travel (the movement\u2019s range of motion) changes, the\nload changes (95 lb.), or your weight changes. This means that every time you do\nFran or a specific benchmark workout, the work is constant.\nSo, you do Fran for the first time and have a Time 1 for it (T1). If you do it a year lat-\ner, the same work was completed but you have a separate time (T2). In comparing\nthe two efforts, we find that the work quantity cancels and the difference in time\nis the difference in power produced (Table 1).\nThere will be measurement error in this calculation. I can measure the force/\nweight with a scale, the distance traveled with a tape measure, and time with a\nwatch. There is not a lot of error therein, but there are some concerns as we are\ncalculating the body\u2019s displacement by using the center of mass, for example.\nHowever, as long as the work is constant, the same error occurs with every effort.\nAnd in comparison from one effort to the next, the errors cancel each other out\n(zero order error). This ratio of time (T2/T1) describes my progress to the accuracy\nand precision of the watch, which is the best of my three tools (stopwatch, tape\nmeasure, scale).\nBy tracking the difference in time between workout attempts, we are looking at\nchanges in power. We did not have to study this much longer to come to this un-\nderstanding that your collection of workout data points represented your work\ncapacity across broad time and modal domains.

First, understand that our defini-\ntions of these quantities are measurable. One of the problems with exercise sci-\nence is that it would very rarely meet the rigors of any real science (chemistry,\nphysics, engineering).\nSecondly, it is also almost never about exercise. For example, maximal oxygen\nconsumption (VO2 max) and lactate threshold are correlates, maybe components,\nbut absolutely subordinate to what happens to work capacity. Who would take an\nincrease in VO2max for a decrease in work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains? What that would look like is breathing more air than you ever had before\non a treadmill test in a lab but losing the road race. Similarly, someone\u2019s lactate\nthreshold could increase, but he or she still gets choked out in the fight because of\nlack of work capacity.\nI could make a list of hundreds of these metrics, and no one has ever produced\na great athlete by advancing them one at a time. It does not happen. I can move\nthem best by doing constantly varied, high-intensity functional movements; doing\nthings that look like Fran, Diane, Helen; turning fitness into sport by working with\nfixed workloads and trying to minimize the time by making every workout a com-\npetitive effort among the cohort.

{"42": "TECHNIQUE\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s Dec. 1, 2007, L1 lecture in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nIn no small part, what is behind this program is the quantification of fitness. This\nmeans we put a number on fitness: work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains. You can assess one\u2019s fitness by determining the area under his or her\nwork-capacity curve. This would be similar to a group of athletes competing in 25\nto 30 workouts. Include a range of activities\u2014like three pulls on the Concept2 row-\ner for average watts to a 10-mile run\u2014and a multitude of workouts in between.\nCompile their overall placing across these events, and everyone then has a reason-\nable metric of his or her total capacity.\nThis quantification of fitness is a part of a broader concept that is at the heart of\nthis movement: We call it evidence-based fitness. This means measurable, observ-\nable, repeatable data is used in analyzing and assessing a fitness program. There\nare three meaningful components to analysis of a fitness program: safety, efficacy,\nand efficiency.\nThe efficacy of a program means, \u201cWhat is the return?\u201d Maybe a fitness program\nadvertises that it will make you a better soccer player. There needs to be evidence\nof this supported by measurable, observable, repeatable data. For CrossFit, we\nwant to increase your work capacity across broad time and modal domains. This is\nthe efficacy of this program. What are the tangible results? What is the adaptation\nthat the program induces?\nEfficiency is the time rate of that adaptation. Maybe the fitness program adver-\ntises that it can deliver 50 pull-ups. There is a big difference whether it takes six\nmonths versus nine years to achieve that.\nSafety is how many people end up at the finish line. Suppose I have a fitness pro-\ngram.

For example, if\nyou want to do a full twisting dismount on the rings, the technique would be: pull,\nlet go, look, arm up, turn, shoulder drop, etc. Technique includes head posture and\nbody posture. And there are effective and less effective techniques. Technique\nincludes the mechanics, but it is in the macro sense of \u201chow do you complete the\nmovement without the physics?\u201d\nForm is the normative value: This is good or this is bad\u2014\u201cyou should\u201d or \u201cyou\nshouldn\u2019t\u201d applied to mechanics and technique.\nStyle is essentially the signature to a movement; that is, that aspect of the move-\nment that is fairly unique to you.

It is the signature. To be truly just\nthe signature, style elements have no bearing on form, technique or mechanics.\nStyle does not enter into the normative assessment, is not important to technique,\nand does not alter substantially the physics.\nThese four terms are all qualifications to movement.

Being able to shoot accurately and quickly is better than quickly or accurately.\nYou may try to get a job as a typist because you do not make any mistakes.

Work at that 10,000 to 12,000\nfoot-pounds per minute mark to fix the form, and soon enough you will have great\ntechnique at 12,000 foot-pounds per minute. The next step is to achieve that tech-\nnique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute.\nAt first, the technique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute will suffer. Then you must\nnarrow it in.

How much carbohydrate is that? In the qualitative\nsense, your insulin level is \u201ctoo high\u201d if it is driving up your blood pressure, mak-\ning you fat or reducing your ability to suppress blood sugar after eating carbo-\nhydrate.

We can make\nthe Zone more complicated or simpler, but not more effective.\nWe encourage everyone to weigh and measure portions for a couple weeks\nbecause it is supremely worth the effort, not because it is fun. If you choose to\n\u201cguesstimate\u201d portions, you will have the result of CrossFit\u2019s top performers only\nif and when you are lucky.\nWithin a couple of weeks of weighing and measuring, you will have developed an\nuncanny ability to estimate the mass of common food portions, but, more impor-\ntantly, you will have formed a keen visual sense of your nutritional needs. This is a\nprofound awareness.\nIn the Zone scheme, all of humanity calculates to either 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-block meals\nat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with either 1- or 2-block snacks between lunch and\ndinner and again between dinner and bedtime. We have simplified the process for\ndetermining which of the four meal sizes and two snack sizes best suits your needs\n(Table 1).

{"67": "TYPICAL CROSSFIT BLOCK PRESCRIPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS\nTo best understand the Zone Diet, CrossFit athletes should read Dr. Barry Sears\u2019\nbook \u201cEnter the Zone.\u201d This article gives more information regarding block pre-\nscriptions and fat adjustments for CrossFit athletes.\nThe chart based on sex and body type in the article \u201cZone Meal Plans\u201d is perfect\nfor those who want to start the Zone Diet. If the athlete chooses the wrong block\nsize and does not obtain the desired results, the plan can be modified after a few\nweeks. Errors in block selection might slow progress, but initial errors are offset by\nthe huge value in starting a practice of weighing and measuring intake.\nSears details a more precise method to calculate one\u2019s block prescription in \u201cEnter\nthe Zone.\u201d It is:\nZone block prescription = lean body mass (lb.) x activity level (g/lb. of lean\nbody mass) / 7 (g protein/block)\nThe activity level ranges on a scale of 0-1. For those who work out several days a\nweek and do not have a labor-intensive job, the activity level should be 0.7 (most\nCrossFit athletes). By dividing 0.7 by 7 g in the equation, this simplifies to a Zone\nblock prescription that is 10 percent of his or her lean mass.\nThe activity factor should increase if the athlete does CrossFit two or more times a\nday, trains for another sport in addition to CrossFit, or holds a strenuous daily job\n(e.g., construction, farming, etc., and potentially coaching, if on one\u2019s feet all day).\nAlthough CrossFit workouts are relatively intense, they are not long in duration.\nAn individual does not need to increase the activity level value based on intensity\nalone; activity volume determines activity factor.\nSAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE ZONE BLOCK PRESCRIPTION\nSuppose an athlete is 185 lb. (84 kg) with 16 percent body fat. He does CrossFit five\ndays per week and works in a typical office environment. A sample calculation of"}
{"68": "TABLE 1. MACRONUTRIENT AND CALORIE COMPOSITION\nFOR 15 BLOCKS A DAY\nProtein 15 blocks x 7 g = 105 g (420 calories)\nCarbohydrate 15 blocks x 9 g = 135 g (540 calories)\nFat 15 blocks x 3 g = 45 g (405 calories)\nTotal Calories = 1,365\nNote the total calories presented here are underestimated due to hidden calories.\nMost foods are classified by a single macronutrient, despite the presence of some\nother macronutrients (e.g., nuts are classified as a fat but have some protein and\ncarbohydrate calories). These less predominant macronutrients for each source\nare not included in the total calorie calculations.\nThis athlete could also choose to round up to 16 blocks, particularly if he or she is\nmore likely to have compliance issues. The Zone prescription is a calorie-restrictive\ndiet and can be especially difficult for new adopters. When one\u2019s calculation has a\ndecimal value, rounding up to the next whole block might result in slower progress\nbut produce better long-term compliance. Once the athlete has become accus-\ntomed to the diet, then the total blocks can be rounded down to 15, particularly if\ndesired body composition has not been achieved.\nINCREASING FAT INTAKE\nThe caloric restriction leans out the athlete while providing enough protein and\ncarbohydrate for typical CrossFit activity levels. However, the athlete can become\ntoo lean. The athlete is considered \u201ctoo lean\u201d when performance decreases in\ncombination with continued weight loss. \u201cToo lean\u201d should not be based on body\nweight or appearance alone. When a loss of mass coincides with a drop in perfor-\nmance, the athlete needs to add calories to the diet. This can be accomplished by\ndoubling the fat intake (Table 2)."}
{"69": "At twice the fat, the macronutrient ratio based on calories has changed from 30\npercent protein, 40 percent carbohydrate, 30 percent fat to 23 percent protein,\n31 percent carbohydrate, 46 percent fat. Fat can continue to be multiplied if the\nathlete experiences further mass loss and performance decline. Some CrossFit\nathletes have a diet including five times the fat (Table 3).\nTABLE 3.

{"70": "SUPPLEMENTATION\nWhole, unprocessed foods are the best source of both macronutrients and micro-\nnutrients in terms of composition, variety, and density, such that supplementation\nis generally not recommended. We contend that eating a diet composed of known\nquantities and of high-quality whole foods is the most important aspect of nutri-\ntion for improved performance and health. Not only are supplements generally\npoorer nutrient sources, but they are also an unnecessary focus for someone not\nfollowing our basic diet plan of weighed and measured meat and vegetables, etc.\nHowever, we find one supplement beneficial enough to make a blanket recom-\nmendation: fish oil. Fish oil provides omega-3 fatty acids, which are a type of poly-\nunsaturated fat.\nPhysiological fats are known as triglycerides in biological terms; they are composed\nof a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached (Figure 1). The attached fatty\nacids are mixtures of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats. Al-\nthough one fatty acid is prominent in each food, all three are represented to some\ndegree. Figure 2 provides a summary of the types of fat and example food sources.\nThe two types of polyunsaturated fats found most frequently in foods are ome-\nga-3 and omega-6 fats. Classifying a fatty acid as omega-3 versus omega-6 is\ndependent on chemical structure. Polyunsaturated fats are sources of the two\nessential fatty acids, meaning they must be obtained from the diet. They are al-\npha-linolenic acid (ALA) (an omega-3) and linoleic acid (LA) (an omega-6). Ome-\nga-3 fats are known as \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d fats, and omega-6 fats are known as\n\u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d fats based on their physiological functions. Both are needed\nin relatively equal quantities."}

Fish oil provides two types\nof omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid\n(DHA), the form of omega-3 fats preferred by the brain and body. The body can\nconvert ALA to EPA and DHA, but the conversion process is inefficient. Some prac-\ntitioners have recommended a combined daily intake on the order of 3 grams of\nEPA and DHA for an otherwise healthy individual, although the exact amount is\ndictated by one\u2019s total omega-6 intake. Each brand of fish oil has a different con-\ncentration of EPA and DHA per serving as indicated on the label. Individuals might\nhave to take multiple servings to get 3 grams of EPA and DHA, as brands might\ninclude omega-3s that are neither EPA nor DHA (e.g., ALA). Flax seed or oil is not an\nappropriate supplement for omega-3s. Flax is a good source of ALA, but because\nof the poor conversion to EPA and DHA, it is not recommended. If the individual is\nvegan, DHA can be obtained with algae oil.\nResearch has indicated positive health benefits by supplementing with fish oil.\nOmega-3 fats help increase the fluidity of cell membranes, and research has in-\ndicated supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular function,\nnervous-system function, immune health, memory, and mood issues.

There are other factors that\nwill ultimately overshadow any disadvantages inherent in the potentially less ef-\nfective regimen, such as convenience, attitude, exercise selection, and pacing.\nFor the remainder of this article the three-day cycle is the one in discussion, but\nmost of the analysis and discussion applies perfectly to the five-day cycle.\nELEMENTS BY MODALITY\nLooking at the Template Macro View (Table 1) it can readily be seen that the tem-\nplate is based on the rotation of three distinct modalities: monostructural meta-\nbolic conditioning (M), gymnastics (G), and weightlifting (W). The monostructural\nmetabolic conditioning activities are commonly referred to as \u201ccardio,\u201d the pur-\npose of which is primarily to improve cardiorespiratory capacity and stamina.\nThey are repetitive, cyclical movements that could be sustained for long periods\nof time. The gymnastics modality comprises body-weight exercises/elements or\ncalisthenics, and its primary purpose is to improve body control by improving\nneurological components such as coordination, balance, agility, and accuracy, and\nto improve functional upper-body capacity and trunk strength. The weightlifting\nmodality comprises the most important weight-training basics, Olympic lifts and\npowerlifting, where the aim is primarily to increase strength, power, and hip/leg\ncapacity. This category includes any exercise with the addition of an external load.\nTable 2 gives the common exercises used by our program, separated by modality,\nin fleshing out the routines.\nFor metabolic conditioning the exercises are run, bike, row, and jump rope. The\ngymnastics modality includes air squats, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, handstand\npush-ups, rope climbs, muscle-ups, presses to handstands, back/hip extensions,\nsit-ups, and jumps (vertical, box, broad, etc.). The weightlifting modality includes\nTABLE 2. EXERCISES BY MODALITY"}
{"76": "deadlifts, cleans, presses, snatches, clean and jerks, medicine-ball drills and\nthrows, and kettlebell swings.\nThe elements, or exercises, chosen for each modality were selected for their\nfunctionality, neuroendocrine response, and overall capacity to dramatically and\nbroadly impact the human body.\nWORKOUT STRUCTURE\nThe workout structure varies by the inclusion of one, two, or three modalities for\neach day (Table 3). Days 1, 5, and 9 are each single-modality workouts whereas days\n2, 6, and 10 include two modalities each (couplets), and finally, days 3, 7, and 11 use\nthree modalities each (triplets). In every case each modality is represented by a\nsingle exercise or element; i.e., each M, W, and G represents a single exercise from\nmetabolic conditioning, weightlifting, and gymnastics modalities respectively.\nWhen the workout includes a single exercise (days 1, 5, and 9) the focus is on a\nsingle exercise or effort. When the element is the single \u201cM\u201d (day 1) the workout is\na single effort and is typically a long, slow, distance effort. When the modality is a\nsingle \u201cG\u201d (day 5) the workout is practice of a single skill, and typically this skill is\nsufficiently complex to require great practice but might not be yet suitable for in-\nclusion in a timed workout because performance is not yet adequate for efficient\ninclusion. When the modality is the single \u201cW\u201d (day 9) the workout is a single lift and\ntypically performed at high weight and low repetition. It is worth repeating that the\nfocus on days 1, 5, and 9 is single efforts of \u201ccardio\u201d at long distance; improving\nhigh-skill, more complex gymnastics movements; and single/low-rep heavy\nweightlifting basics, respectively. This is not the day to work sprints, pull-ups, or\nhigh-repetition clean and jerks \u2014the other days would be more appropriate.\nTABLE 3.

{"79": "SCALING CROSSFIT\nCrossFit workouts, and especially those on CrossFit.com, are designed to chal-\nlenge even the most advanced athlete. Many athletes need to \u201cscale\u201d (i.e., modify)\nthe workouts for the safest implementation of the program. Finding a CrossFit\naffiliate is one way to receive proper coaching and guidance through this pro-\ncess. In absence of an experienced trainer, this article presents some basic\nconcepts for scaling workouts particularly for beginners. Scaling for other pop-\nulations (e.g., advanced or injured athletes) is discussed in greater detail at the\nLevel 2 Certificate Course, as well as in the Online Scaling Course.\nAthletes will need to scale workouts for variable lengths of time. One\u2019s athletic\nbackground, as well as his or her current health and fitness capacity, dictates how\nlong scaling is necessary. The methodology presented here can be used indefi-\nnitely, but a month is the minimum period for which significant scaling should be\napplied. This introductory period serves two purposes: 1) it develops competency\nof movements used in CrossFit; and 2) it appropriately exposes the athlete to grad-\nual increases in intensity and volume.\nMECHANICS AND CONSISTENCY FIRST\nCrossFit\u2019s charter for creating the most optimal balance of safety, efficacy, and\nefficiency is: mechanics, consistency, then\u2014and only then\u2014intensity. The initial\nexposure to CrossFit is when movement mechanics should be prioritized over in-\ntensity. And for some, just practicing the movements will be intense. It is impera-\ntive that the movements can be performed correctly and consistently before load\nand speed are added. While intensity is an important part of the CrossFit program,\nit is added after movement proficiency is established. Ignoring this order increas-\nes the risk for injury and potentially blunts long-term progress, especially if poor\nmechanics are combined with load.\nSCALING EFFECTIVELY: PRESERVE THE STIMULUS\nWhen scaling workouts, the main principle to follow is \u201cpreserve the stimulus.\u201d"}
{"80": "Intensity and Volume\nTwo factors need to be scaled for every beginner: 1) intensity; and 2) volume. A\nprudent method for beginners is reducing intensity and/or volume by half for at\nleast two weeks. Depending on how the athlete progresses, volume and intensity\ncan be gradually increased in the following weeks, months, and years.\nIntensity refers to the amount of power an athlete generates. Intensity may be\nmodified in three ways: 1) load; 2) speed; and/or 3) volume.\nLoad is the variable to scale first; scaling the load is an easy way to preserve the\nstimulus relative to an athlete\u2019s capacity. Load is also the most common variable\nmodified after the beginner period. Especially for a conditioning workout, the ath-\nlete should use a load that ensures he or she is able to complete the first set or\nround without compromising form or reaching muscular failure. Determining ap-\npropriate loads for newer athletes requires some estimation, and scaling will not\nalways be perfect. Often, loads for newer athletes will be less than 50 percent\nof the prescribed load, especially if an athlete is new to lifting weights. Coaches\nshould err on the side of scaling too much rather than not enough, particularly for\nnewer athletes.\nSpeed tends to be more self-modulated due to the athlete\u2019s fitness level, although\na coach can modulate speed based on the mechanics demonstrated. A coach\nmight have to slow an athlete down to achieve the correct mechanics. Similarly,\ncoaches might have to encourage an athlete who is moving well to move faster,\nthough this is less common when working with beginners (see \u201cTechnique\u201d article).\nVolume is the total amount of work accomplished by the athlete. Depending on\nthe workout, volume can be lowered by reducing: 1) time; 2) reps/rounds; and/or\n3) distance.\nNewer CrossFit athletes might attempt to struggle through a workout where\nthe volume of repetitions (or load, above) is beyond their current capacity. For\nexample, an advanced CrossFit athlete might complete Fran in 2 minutes. That"}
{"81": "Movements\nWhen a movement cannot be performed at all, it can be substituted. CrossFit\nsuggests modifying this variable last because avoiding a movement prevents an\nindividual from developing proficiency in it. An athlete or trainer should first try re-\nducing the load before substituting the movement. If the workout calls for snatch-\nes at 95 lb., for example, it is generally preferable that the athlete performs the\nsnatches with a PVC pipe instead of substituting 95-lb. overhead squats.\nComplete movement substitutions should be considered when a physical limita-\ntion or injury is present, or when the load cannot be reduced. When selecting a\nsubstitute movement, trainers should try to preserve the original movement\u2019s\nfunction and range of motion as best they can. When determining movement sub-\nstitutions consider:\n1) Whether the movement is primarily driven by the lower body or\nupper body.\n2) The movement function (e.g., push versus pull).\n3) The range of motion used by the movement (specifically of the hips,\nknees, and ankles).\n4) The plane of movement.\nParticularly in the case of injury, a complete movement replacement might be nec-\nessary. Consideration of these variables can help trainers select a movement sub-\nstitution or replacement that is as similar as possible to the prescribed movement.\nA SAMPLE WEEK OF SCALING\nThis section outlines five typical CrossFit workouts. For each Workout of the Day\n(WOD), scaled workouts are presented with modifications to volume, load, and\nmovements. Some of the rationale for the options is also described. These scaled\nworkouts should be considered but three examples of the many options available.\nThey do not take the place of scaled workouts created by an experienced trainer\nwho is relying on intuition and detailed knowledge of a specific athlete."}

Doing so will allow the individual to achieve almost the same volume\nwhile he or she develops new skills and/or is exposed to heavier elements.\nCONCLUSION\nAthletes and their trainers should focus on movement proficiency before adding\nspeed and load.

{"108": "THE AIR SQUAT\nAll our athletes begin their squatting with the \u201cair squat\u201d; that is, without any\nweight other than body weight. As a matter of terminology, when we refer to the\n\u201csquat\u201d we are talking about an unladen, body-weight-only squat. When we wish\nto refer to a weighted squat we will use the term back squat, overhead squat, or\nfront squat, referring to those distinct weighted squats. Training with the front,\nback, and overhead squats before the weightless variant has been mastered re-\ntards athletic potential and compromises safety and efficacy.\nWhen has the squat been mastered? This is a good question. It is fair to say that\nthe squat is mastered when both technique and performance are superior. This\nsuggests that none of the points of performance are deficient and fast multiple\nreps are possible. Our favorite standard for fast multiple reps would be the Ta-\nbata squat (20 seconds on/10 seconds off repeated 8 times) with the weakest of\neight intervals being between 18 and 20 reps. Do not misunderstand \u2014we are\nlooking for 18-20 perfect squats in 20 seconds, rest for 10, and repeat seven\nmore times for a total of eight intervals.\nThe most common faults to look for are surrendering of the lumbar curve at the\nbottom, not breaking the parallel plane with the hips, slouching in the chest and\nshoulders, lifting the heels, and not fully extending the hip at the top (Figure 1).\nDo not even think about weighted squats until none of these faults belong to you.\nA relatively small angle of hip extension, while indicative of a beginner\u2019s or weak\nsquat and caused by weak hips extensors, is not strictly considered a fault as\nlong as the lumbar spine is neutral.\nCAUSES OF A BAD SQUAT\n1) Weak glute/hamstring. The glutes and hams are responsible for powerful\nhip extension, which is the key to the athletic performance universe.\n2) Poor engagement, weak control, and no awareness of glute and\nhamstring. The road to powerful, effective hip extension is a three-to-\nfive-year odyssey for most athletes."}

In athletic pursuits you might be\nprone to injury. Should they converge, you are developing useful strength and\npower that can be successfully applied to athletic movements.\nThe functional application or utility of the overhead squat might not be readily\napparent, but there are many real-world occurrences where objects high enough\nto get under are too heavy or not free enough to be jerked or pressed overhead"}

{"121": "body from which these movements emanate, the core, is often referred to as the\n\u201cpower zone.\u201d The muscle groups comprising the \u201cpower zone\u201d include the hip flex-\nors, hip extensors (glutes and hams), spinal erectors, and quadriceps.\nThese lifts are enormous aids to developing the power zone. Additionally, the ad-\nvanced elements of the progression, the push press and jerk, train for and devel-\nop power and speed. Power and speed are \u201cking\u201d in sport performance. Coupling\nforce with velocity is the very essence of power and speed. Some of our favorite\nand most developmental lifts lack this quality.

{"124": "SUMMARY\nFrom shoulder press to push jerk the movements become increasingly more ath-\nletic, functional, and suited to heavier loads. The progression also increasingly\nrelies on the power zone. In the shoulder press, the power zone is used for stabi-\nlization only. In the push press the power zone provides not only stability but also\nthe primary impetus in both the dip and drive. In the push jerk the power zone is\ncalled on for the dip, drive, second dip, and squat. The role of the hip is increased\nin each exercise.\nWith the push press you will be able to drive overhead as much as 30 percent more\nweight than with the shoulder press. The push jerk will allow you to drive as much\nas 30 percent more overhead than you would with the push press.\nIn effect the hip is increasingly recruited through the progression of lifts to assist\nthe arms and shoulders in raising loads overhead. After mastering the push jerk\nyou will find that it will unconsciously displace the push press as your method of\nchoice when going overhead.\nThe second dip on the push jerk will become lower and lower as you both master\nthe technique and increase the load. At some point in your development, the loads\nwill become so substantial that the upper body cannot contribute but a fraction\nto the movement, at which point the catch becomes very low and an increasing\namount of the lift is accomplished by the overhead squat.\nOn both the push press and jerk, the \u201cdip\u201d is critical to the entire movement. The\nstomach is held very tightly and the resultant turnaround from dip to drive is sud-\nden, explosive, and violent.\nTRY THESE\n1) Start with 95 lb. and push press or push jerk 15 straight repetitions, rest\n30 seconds, and repeat for total of 5 sets of 15 repetitions each. Go up\nin weight only when you can complete all 5 sets with only 30 seconds of\nrest between each and do not pause in any set."}

{"133": "THE GLUTE-HAM DEVELOPER (GHD)\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s March 18, 2007, L1 lecture in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nOur definition of core strength is midline stabilization. In profile, there is a ref-\nerence line that trisects the spine and bisects the pelvis. Midline stabilization is\nthe ability to maintain rigidity, stability, and a lack of deflection about that line\n(Figure 1). This translates to improved efficiency and performance and greater\npower output.\nIt is critical to the deadlift, to the laden squat, to the shoulder press, and to any\nsport. In a swimmer\u2019s stroke\u2014when the left leg kicks and right arm pulls\u2014if the\ntorso deviates to one side, you lose energy. Energy is lost in its deflection, wheth-\ner throwing a punch, riding a bicycle, or squatting. The abdominals, with the hip\nflexors, control one side of the torso, with the hip extensors and erectors involved\non the other side.\nHowever, what we have in modern physical culture is an excessive awareness\nand focus on the anterior and not on the posterior. As a culture of athletes and\nnon-athletes alike, we are unfortunately frontally fixated. Pecs\u2014what about the\nrhomboids? Abs\u2014what about the erectors? Quads\u2014what about the glute-ham-\nstring? And for the best of functional movement\u2014punch, jump, throw, run\u2014the\nimpetus comes out of the posterior.\nWe see communities where there is a very deliberate and concerted effort to min-\nimize hip-flexor involvement in exercise. And yet, by insertion and origin, by me-\nchanical position and advantage, and just kinematically, the hip flexors, have\nseveral times the contraction capacity that is estimated of the abdominals. All of it:\nhip extensors, hip flexors, trunk flexors, and ex-\ntensors are essential to midline stabilization. The\nabdominals are just one part of the story.\nFor core strength (midline stabilization), we are"}

There is no trunk-extension work, no hip-extension\nwork, and hip flexion is deliberately limited. Some of these communities also have\nproblems with chronic back injury, which comes at no surprise. If there is anything\nto \u201cmuscle balance,\u201d it makes sense. In how many communities are they doing an\nequal number of deadlifts and squats to their sit-ups? Most of the military/law-en-\nforcement PT is completely devoid of full-range-of-motion hip extension. Rucking,\nrunning, jumping jacks\u2014all will not do it. The run, pull-up, sit-up, push-up, lath-\ner-rinse-repeat PT has no real good core movement. The crunch does not count.\nWhile a cumbersome and space-taking piece of gear, the GHD has been essential\nto our work. We have four of them in 2,500 square feet, so one every 600 feet.\nWe use the GHD for four exercises to heighten awareness and develop capacity\nat midline stabilization. The punchline to the story is that static contractions that\nstabilize the midsection are the most important and functional (powerful) muscu-\nlar contractions in that region. Static contractions for midline stabilization are the\nbest ab exercises known. No amount of crunches are ever going to get you to the\nsame end point as the L-sit, overhead squat, deadlift, etc.\nWhat we suspect is that if you could sequentially fire the abs with the same force\nin any kind of dynamic pattern, you would have the ability to seriously injure your\nspine. If you could ever crunch with the same force that you can stabilize, you\nwould be able to break your back at will. We have come hardwired unable to do\nthat\u2014that is my guess.\nThe movements are presented in the order in which they should be developed in\na client.

Then the back extends sequentially along the spine from \u201csouth\nto north\u201d (Figure 5).\nThis movement does a lot for a coach. It heightens a neurological awareness. It\nallows me to introduce some essential vernacular to the client. If we do not have\ncues that allow me to talk about hip flexion, trunk flexion, hip extension, trunk ex-\ntension, I am fairly worthless with a client. Very early, get clients to know terms. Be\nable to call it out and get the response you need.\nThis movement demonstrates tremendous control. There is hip flexion, hip ex-\ntension, trunk flexion and trunk extension in a combo \u201csnake\u201d move. Using those\nmuscles is essential for midline stabilization and working the posterior.\nThe fourth movement on the GHD is a sit-up but involves no trunk flexion. For the\nGHD sit-up, the pad is set so that the pelvis is free, and the athlete descends back\nto touch the ground and then comes back to seated. More than a few exercise\nphysiologists and certified trainers have observed that this movement is pure hip\nflexion and consequently asserted \u201cthere\u2019s no abs in that.\u201d\nBut what the abs are doing in this exercise is midline stabilization.\nBefore having clients perform the GHD sit-up, ensure they have demonstrated ca-\npacity in the hip extension, back extension, and hip-and-back extension. Even still,\ntheir first GHD sit-ups should be performed in a shortened range of motion, with\nthe trainer spotting behind them (Figure 6). That might be it for the first dose. Once\nthey come back and you can determine the effect from that dose, increase the\nrange of motion and volume as their capacity allows.\nTo perform a GHD sit-up, there is some leg flexion in the descent. Then, the leg\nextends dramatically and pulls the athlete to seated (Figure 7). Conversely, if the\nathlete does not extend the leg to come to seated, the primary movers are the hip"}
{"142": "The force with which an athlete comes up is amazing. Rather than being pulled\nfrom the psoas alone, which is a fairly dysfunctional kind of pull, the athlete uses\nthe full complement of hip-flexor musculature. Any time you are using a fraction of\nthe primary movers responsible for that articulation, it is not natural, not function-\nal, and contrary to nature. Not extending the leg can also be a little irritating to the\nlow back due to this shearing force on the lumbar spine. Performed correctly, the\nmovement is not irritating to the low back. Straightening that leg enables profound\nmusculature to lift from the pelvis.\nThere are people who have this irritation in the spine from a shear force. If you can\nteach them to extend the legs to work the full complement of hip flexors, we will\nmove the margins where this irritation occurs from 3 reps to 4 reps to 10 reps and\nso on. That is rehabilitation. That is neuromuscular re-education.\nThere is an adjunct movement to GHD sit-up in which the athlete is dynamic in the\ntrunk and static in the hip. It is the AbMat sit-up, where we deliberately take the\nhip flexors out of the equation and work the torso dynamically. The hip flexors are\nworking statically or possibly to no significant degree.\nTo do this, the hip flexors need to be removed from the line of action. The fat part\nof the AbMat goes toward the glutes, and the athlete puts the bottom of his or her\nsoles together with the knees butterflied. This positioning makes the hip flexors\ntangential to the line of action; i.e., they cannot do any productive work. This is\ndone deliberately. Then the athlete slowly and under control comes to seated by\ncontracting the abdominals. This is a very dynamic bit of trunk flexion and the hip\nflexors are removed (Figure 8).\nAs the athlete fails, adduct and extend the legs to some degree. This creates more\npurchase for the hip flexors and brings them into the line of action. This allows the\nathlete to modulate the assistance and keep each rep focused on the midsection.\nIf reps are performed slowly and deliberately, most athletes will fail a sit-up with-\nout an AbMat. The failure is not necessarily a neuromuscular failure. It is not"}

But that lum-\nbar region is fairly inflexible, and all that range of motion that is available moves\none from spinally extended through to neutral. There is no more shortening or\nflexion to it; it is not enough to sit up.\nWithout the AbMat, the sit-up is a biphasic movement. While I have solid contact,\nI use upper rectus and create enough momentum to throw the load to the hip\nflexors, where I have more connection. This means that the full rectus has little\nstimulus\u2014it is pulling me from spinally extended through to neutral, but absent\nof any load. The upper rectus is worked where there is a fulcrum, so the back flat-\ntens, but it is the hip flexors that pull me to seated. There is no amount of sit-ups\nyou can do on the ground that is ever going to work you from pubic bone to about\n3 or 4 inches above the belly button. The AbMat moves the athlete from spinally\nextended through to neutral in the lumbar spine against a load.\nHow big would your bench press get if you only pushed air? You would get as\nstrong as your abs will with a ground-based sit-up. With or without the pad, there\nis the same contraction and range of motion in the midsection. Without the pad,\nthe fibers shortened but there was no load and no real work completed. With the\npad, they got the same motion but under a load, and it produced fruitful work.\nThe two sit-ups, GHD and AbMat, complement each other beautifully. One is dy-\nnamic in the hips and static in the trunk; the other is dynamic in the trunk and stat-\nic in the hip. In conjunction with the L-sit (static in the trunk and hip), they develop\na formidable capacity in the midline."}

To communicate knowledge to oth-\ners, a coach must understand what defines proper mechanics and what causes\nbad or inefficient movement. This requires continual study, and one\u2019s teaching will\nimprove with greater understanding in all fields that intersect with fitness.\nAn effective teacher also has a unique ability to relate to every student, regardless\nof his or her background and ability. This requires the teacher to distill a large body\nof knowledge to a single point or a few salient points specific to the current need\nof the athlete and the movement being taught. An effective teacher also takes\nownership for recognizing when communication between the teacher and athlete\nbreaks down. Generally, the more forms of communication a teacher employs\n(verbal, visual, tactile, use of different examples/ analogies, etc.), the more likely\nthe athlete will find success in training.\n2. Seeing\u2014The ability to discern good from poor movement mechanics\nand to identify both gross and subtle faults whether the athlete is in\nmotion or static.\nAn effective trainer demonstrates the ability to see movement and determine\nwhether the mechanics are sound or unsound. This ability first requires knowl-\nedge of when to observe and evaluate very specific aspects of the athlete\u2019s move-\nment (e.g., trunk-to-femur relationship for hip extension, center of pressure on\nfeet for posterior-chain engagement). It also requires knowledge of the differences\nbetween good and poor positions. An effective trainer can see faults both when\nthe athlete is moving (e.g., hip extension) and not moving (e.g., the receiving posi-\ntion of a clean). Newer coaches tend to have the greatest difficulty spotting move-\nment faults while athletes are moving.\n3. Correcting\u2014The ability to facilitate better mechanics for an athlete"}

A trainer needs multiple strategies for each fault because\ndifferent clients often respond to the same cue in a different manner.\nWhen multiple faults occur at once, a trainer is best served by attacking them one\nat a time in order of importance (i.e., triaging). The ordering is based on the se-\nverity of the deviation from ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task; no\nsingle ordering of faults can be used across all athletes and movements. Through-\nout the cueing process, a trainer needs to celebrate small changes or even just\ncelebrate hard work to build rapport and acknowledge a client\u2019s effort even when\nthose efforts are not immediately successful.\nNewer trainers tend to be lacking in their ability to see and correct movement.\nWhen coaching others, trainers need to focus on movement. Good coaches re-\nlentlessly watch movement with a critical eye. Good coaches are constantly ask-\ning the following questions: How could an individual be more efficient and safe?\nWhat cues would result in a better position? How can cues be delivered to produce\nthe best response from the athlete? Good coaches produce noticeable changes in\ntheir athletes\u2019 movement. To develop this critical eye, coaches can work with great\ntrainers, film themselves or other athletes, or film classes.\n4.

{"148": "HOW TO DEVELOP AS A TRAINER\nTo keep up with athletes\u2019 progress, a coach must continue to refine and develop\nhis or her knowledge. If a trainer\u2019s clients are not testing the limits of his or her\nknowledge, the trainer is not doing a good enough job with them. An expert coach\nis eager and proud to have a student exceed his or her abilities but seeks to delay\nit by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the athlete\u2019s\ngrowth. Coaches should focus on development in both academic and practical\nenvironments.\nHere are some suggestions for how trainers can develop:\n1) First and foremost, teach to learn. It is only through experience that\na trainer will learn and gain competency. It is imperative to work with\npeople in a dynamic environment, even if they are friends or family\nin the beginning. Understanding biochemistry, anatomy and teaching\nmethodologies is important and supportive of this endeavor, but it is not\nenough to allow a trainer to apply knowledge in real time.\n2) Watch more experienced coaches\u2014regardless of their specific discipline.\nWatch what they watch and when they watch for it. Listen to their cues.\nThe best coaches often need very few words to produce noticeable\nimprovement in mechanics. Also watch their rapport with clients. What\ndraws clients to them?\n3) Film yourself coaching others. This can also help with your ability to see\nand correct movement faults as you have the luxury of slowing down the\nfootage. Be critical of yourself and use the six criteria detailed above to\nassess strengths and areas for improvement.\n4) Attend a Level 2 Certificate Course (L2). The L2 allows trainers to work\non their coaching (specifically seeing and correcting movement) in the\npresence of their peers. Where the Level 1 Course is important for\nunderstanding the conceptual framework of CrossFit, the goal of the"}

Un-\nder its Certification branch, CrossFit offers courses on topics such as anat-\nomy and physiology and best business practices. Those pursing advanced\ncredentials in CrossFit may use these courses for required continuing-edu-\ncation credits, but the courses are open to anyone.\n6) Read and study everything related to training, movement and health.\n7) Study and follow CrossFit.com. The archives (since 2001) contain years\nof original CrossFit programming. It is a great resource for learning\nand experimenting with workouts. We challenge all trainers to follow\nCrossFit.com programming for at least six months to understand well-\nvaried and challenging CrossFit programming. It provides a good model\nfor the type of workouts, the variance and the volume (i.e., one workout\na day) required for long-term results. It will also provide experience\non how to scale appropriately, as only the most advanced athletes can\ncomplete all CrossFit.com workouts as prescribed (Rx\u2019d).\n8) Pursue higher credentials, such as CrossFit Level 2 Trainer, Certified\nCrossFit Trainer (Level 3) and Certified CrossFit Coach (Level 4). More\ninformation about the Level 2 credential can be found on CrossFit.com/\ncertificate-courses, and more information about the certifications can\nbe found on CrossFit.com/certifications. The CrossFit Level 4 Coach\ncredential is the preeminent trainer designation offered by CrossFit. This\nevaluation provides distinction for expert coaches within the community.\nHOW TO TRAIN OTHERS WHILE GAINING EXPERTISE\nExpert training comes from years of experience and study long after the comple-\ntion of the Level 1 Certificate Course. However, a novice or less experienced person\ncan still train others. Three important principles should guide trainers at all levels:\n\u2022 Master the fundamentals.\n\u2022 Limit the scope.\n\u2022 Pursue excellence."}

These guidelines enable\ntrainers to learn and gain experience while safeguarding the health and well-being\nof people in their care.\nApplying intensity at either end of the spectrum\u2013too much too soon or too little/\nnone at all\u2013blunts the overall benefit from the program. Pushing one\u2019s limits drives\nnew adaptation, and this cannot happen without intensity. On the other hand,\npushing too hard too soon can result in long-term inefficiencies or injury. When\nthe trainer is in doubt, it is better to err on the side of caution and progress slow-\nly. Even at low intensity, many participants see benefits simply from performing\nvaried functional movements, and it will become clear over time when intensity\ncan be added.\nLimit the Scope\nMany CrossFit affiliates follow a group-class model, which can be difficult for a\nnovice coach. The demands of teaching and class management often take the\nattention away from seeing and correcting movement. New trainers are encour-\naged to coach friends and family in individual or small group sessions (two or\nthree athletes) to perfect their ability to improve mechanics before taking on large\ngroup classes. Another option is to assist a head coach for classes and small-group\ntraining. The new trainer can improve his or her ability to discern poor move-\nment and cue good movement, while the head trainer addresses the other logis-\ntics. New trainers should seek out internships or assistant roles at local affiliates\nto gain this experience.

Rather than devising a business model in the pur-\nsuit of money, devise one that is focused on making the training (and, by exten-\nsion, the clients) better. The most effective business plan comes from achieving\nexcellence and letting the market bring the money to you.\nTo pursue excellence, ask the question, \u201cWhat would make the training or the af-\nfiliate better?\u201d An analysis of pros and cons can muddle every decision, and most\nissues can be decided by a simple question: \u201cWill it improve the quality of the pro-\ngramming or the training experience?\u201d If the answer is \u201cYes!\u201d you are most likely\npursuing excellence.\nCROSSFIT COMMUNITY AND REPRESENTATION\nThe Level 1 Certificate Course is a great way to formalize one\u2019s involvement in\nthe CrossFit community.

Rhabdo-\nmyolysis (often simply referred to as \u201crhabdo\u201d) is a medical condition that might\narise from breakdown of muscle tissue and release of the muscle cells\u2019 contents\ninto the bloodstream. This process can damage the kidneys and can lead to renal\nfailure or death in rare cases. Rhabdo is diagnosed when a patient with an appro-\npriate history has an elevated level of creatine kinase, also known as CK or CPK.\nCPK is easier to measure in the blood than myoglobin and is generally used as a\nmarker for rhabdo, even though it is the myoglobin that does the damage.\nTreatment consists of generous amounts of intravenous (IV) fluids to dilute and\nflush the myoglobin through the kidneys. In the worst cases, patients might need\ndialysis while the kidneys recover. Death, though rare, can result when kidney fail-\nure causes imbalances in the usual electrolytes, which can cause cardiac arrhyth-\nmias. Most patients make a complete recovery after being rehydrated with IV fluids\nover anywhere from several hours to a week or so, depending on the severity.\nThere are a few ways a CrossFit trainer can protect athletes from rhabdomyolysis:\n\u2022 Follow the charter of mechanics, consistency, intensity.\n\u2022 Know the movements that have a higher rate of rhabdomyolysis incidence\n(those that prolong the eccentric contraction), and be mindful of the total"}

At affiliates where there are \u201celements\u201d or \u201con-ramp\u201d classes that last a\ncouple of weeks, athletes should still be heavily scaled beyond this introductory\nperiod to ensure adequate time to acclimate to CrossFit training. If there are no\nseparate classes for beginners, treat the workouts as technique sessions for new-\ner athletes\u2013focus on their mechanics rather than speed or load. There is no set\nprotocol for how quickly to increase intensity, but it is wise to err on the side of\ncaution and work toward long-term fitness. Multiple months at scaled loads and\nvolumes are well within a normal timeframe for even the best athletes, with gradu-\nal increases in intensity implemented after that. Trainers need to frequently check\nin with athletes to determine how the previous dose of exercise affected them.\nAlthough intensity is a significant part of CrossFit, each athlete has his or her entire\nlife to continue to improve fitness and tolerance for intensity.\nThe second way to mitigate the risk of rhabdomyolysis is to know the movements\nassociated with a higher rate of incidence. Beginner athletes should keep \u201cnega-\ntives\u201d (movements which prolong the eccentric phase) to a minimum. Although\nnegatives can be an effective way to increase strength, they should not be used\nin high volumes with beginners. Athletes may increase the volume of negatives\ngradually over time.\nWhile the eccentric phase of movements cannot and should not be avoided, there\nare movements in which people are more likely to prolong the eccentric phase. In\nCrossFit, these tend to be jumping pull-ups and full-range-of-motion glute-ham de-\nveloper (GHD) sit-ups. In the jumping pull-up, the athlete should not prolong the\ndescent but should instead immediately drop to an extended-arm position once\nthe chin has cleared the bar, absorbing the impact with the legs. Similarly, in the\nfull-range-of-motion GHD sit-up, newer athletes should use fewer repetitions and\npotentially a shortened range of motion until capacity is developed. It is also prudent\nfor trainers to scale the number of repetitions and the range of motion for athletes\nwho do not routinely use GHD sit-ups regardless of their CrossFit experience. There\nare no exact rules for total volume, but beginners and new CrossFit athletes (and\neven advanced CrossFit athletes who have not been routinely using the GHD) should"}

Certain medications, in-\ncluding statins (cholesterol-lowering agents), increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis.\nSymptoms of rhabdomyolysis include severe generalized muscle pain, nausea\nand vomiting, abdominal cramping, and, in severe cases, dark-red or cola-colored\nurine. The discoloration of the urine comes from the muscle\u2019s myoglobin, which is\nthe same molecule that gives red meat its color. If these symptoms appear follow-\ning a workout (or at any time with regard to dark-red urine), the athlete should seek\nmedical attention immediately.\nThe athletes at highest risk seem to be those with a reasonable baseline level of\nfitness obtained through some non-CrossFit training, those who are returning to\nCrossFit after a layoff, or even experienced CrossFit athletes who reach volume\nor intensity significantly outside their established \u201cnorm.\u201d These athletes have\nsufficient muscle mass and conditioning to create enough intensity to hurt them-\nselves. Generally, the most deconditioned seem to be at less risk (but not zero). It\nis suspected they do not have enough muscle mass or the capacity to generate\nhigh levels of intensity.

Very real risks exist\nfrom equipment condition, use, and arrangement, as well as from improper spot-\nting of athletes during movements.\nEquipment condition refers both to installation and day-to-day maintenance.

Trainers must repair, replace, and discontinue use of faulty\nequipment immediately.\nArrangement refers to the layout of equipment and athletes during a class or\nworkout. Each athlete needs enough space to perform the movements, with an\nadditional buffer to account for the errant-moving equipment, missed attempts,\nand safe passage of coaches or other athletes. Under no circumstances should a\ntrainer permit extra equipment like bars, plates, boxes, etc. to be left lying around\nthe workout area. This equipment might trip athletes or cause a ricochet if other\nequipment lands on it.\nIt is also imperative for a trainer to prepare for falls during dynamic movements. It is\npossible that an athlete might lose his or her grip during a kip (pull-up or muscle-up).\nTrainers might encourage athletes to wrap their thumbs around any bar in an ef-\nfort to provide additional feedback to the athlete. This is not foolproof, however,\nand can sometimes be even less secure, particularly for athletes with small hands.\nWhatever the hand position chosen, it does not replace the need for the athlete to\ndevelop body awareness of when to end the movement if his or her grip is compro-\nmised (wrapping thumbs is always recommended for barbell and ring movements\nto help provide better balance and control, especially in higher-risk scenarios such\nas a bench press or muscle-up). Boxes and racks should not be beneath, behind or\ndirectly in front of these athletes. Adjustable rings should be lowered to the appro-\npriate height. Where assistance boxes are necessary, they are best placed to the side\nof the working athlete (and not in another athlete\u2019s way) to leave a clear path should\nan athlete leave the apparatus prematurely. A suggestion for trainers trying to man-\nage these risks is to do a \u201cdry run\u201d of the workout before it begins: check the working\nspace for each athlete for each of the proposed movements. This can be as simple as\norganizing the class to rotate stations on the trainer\u2019s call and perform a quick walk-\nthrough to check spacing and arrangement. Trainers can then instruct participants\nto move to the same spot during the workout to ensure safety.\nAthletes also need instruction regarding how to bail safely from lifts and how to\nspot other athletes where appropriate.

A blood-spill clean-\nup procedure can be found in the CrossFit Journal archives.\nMONITORING ATHLETES FOR CONDITIONS THAT NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION\nAlthough a trainer is primarily there to instruct and improve athlete movements,\nhe or she needs to monitor the level of exertion during the workout and ensure\nathlete health is protected. As CrossFit workouts use relatively high intensity, ath-\nletes are working at their physical and psychological tolerances. It is possible for\nathletes to push too hard, and confounding environmental factors might exacer-\nbate certain situations.\nExtreme temperature fluctuations, especially heat, can be problematic. Trainers\nshould be ready in unseasonably hot and humid weather with sufficient water, and\nthey should watch for common signs of overexertion (e.g., dizziness). Hot weather\nalso increases the potential risk for rhabdomyolysis (although some cases have\noccurred in cold climates), and trainers should encourage athletes to stay hydrated\n(with the caveat that they should not be excessively hydrated. Current mainstream\nliterature suggests rates of 1.2 L/hour, which are actually too high and can lead to\noverhydration). In the event of a potential heat stroke following a workout (e.g.,\nathlete demonstrates an altered mental state), a trainer should remove excess\nclothing from the athlete and then douse him or her with cool water before med-\nical attention arrives.\nWeather aside, other conditions might need medical attention. Symptoms such\nas numbness or chronic pain in joints and muscles should be referred to medical\nprofessionals. Medical attention is immediately necessary for any non-respon-\nsive athlete."}
{"158": "We advise against rehydration strategies that encourage consumption of fluids to\nprevent loss of body-weight during activity. Dehydration during physical activity is\na normal physiological process, and the thirst mechanism is sufficient in regulating\nhydration and serum sodium concentration during exercise.\nDrinking beyond thirst in an attempt to prevent body-weight loss during exercise\noffers no benefit to health or performance. It also presents a serious risk of ex-\nercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), a potentially deadly dilution of the body\u2019s\nserum sodium concentration. EAH is caused by overconsumption of fluid and can\nbe viewed as an iatrogenic condition due to the prevailing belief that exercising\nathletes should drink \u201cas much fluid as tolerable\u201d during training.\n\u201cFluid\u201d that can contribute to EAH includes electrolyte-enhanced sports drinks.\nContrary to popular belief, these commercial beverages do not reduce risk of hy-\nponatremia. Because of flavoring and sugar content, these drinks might present\ngreater risk for overconsumption of fluid than water alone, increasing the risk of\npotentially deadly EAH in athletes.\nSPECIAL POPULATIONS\nAny potential athlete with a medical condition needs to be cleared by a physician for\nexercise before a trainer recommends a fitness regimen.

Virtuosity is defined in gymnas-\ntics as \u201cperforming the common uncommonly well.\u201d Unlike risk and originality,\nvirtuosity is elusive, supremely elusive. It is, however, readily recognized by the\naudience as well as coaches and athletes. But more importantly, more to my point,\nvirtuosity is more than the requirement for that last tenth of a point; it is always\nthe mark of true mastery (and of genius and beauty).\nThere is a compelling tendency among novices developing any skill or art, whether\nlearning to play the violin, write poetry, or compete in gymnastics, to quickly move\npast the fundamentals and on to more elaborate, more sophisticated movements,\nskills, or techniques. This compulsion is the novice\u2019s curse\u2013the rush to original-\nity and risk.\nThe novice\u2019s curse is manifested as excessive adornment, silly creativity, weak\nfundamentals and, ultimately, marked lack of virtuosity and delayed mastery.

{"162": "PROFESSIONAL TRAINING\nOriginally published in January 2006.\nI am a fitness trainer. My practice is more\nthan just a job; it is my passion. My clients\nare my top priority and their successes\nare my life\u2019s work\u2013I am a professional.\nOn the surface, my job is to shepherd my\nathletes (I view all my clients as athletes\nregardless of their age or ability) toward\nphysical prowess, but I recognize a pur-\npose to my efforts and an impact on my\nathletes that transcends the physical.\nI view training as a physical metaphor\nfor habits and attitudes that foster suc-\ncess in all arenas. I stress that point to\nall who train with me, and I know I have\nbeen successful only after they bring\nback concrete examples.\nThe lessons learned through physical training are unavoidable. The character\ntraits required and developed through physical training are universally applicable\nto all endeavors. Perseverance, industry, sacrifice, self-control, integrity, honesty,\nand commitment are best and easiest learned in the gym. Even clients who have\nfound spectacular success in business, sport, war, or love find their most import-\nant values buttressed, refined, and nourished in rigorous training.\nBeing a professional, I believe that my competency is solely determined by my\nefficacy.

{"163": "My commitment to my athletes is clearly expressed and perceived in our first\nmeeting. I am all theirs. They are the object of my focus and the focus of my con-\nversation. They come back not because of my physical capacity but because they\nbelieve in my capacity to develop theirs. World-class athletes rarely make world-\nclass trainers.\nI understand that the modern and near-universal trend of skill-less and low-skill\nprogramming delivers inferior results and makes cheerleaders of trainers. I will\nhave none of it. I have to understand the mechanics, cues, and techniques of com-\nplex movements and to be able to teach them to others. I bring a skill set to my\ntraining that scares off most trainers.\nKeeping up with my athletes\u2019 progress demands that I continue to refine and ad-\nvance my understanding of advanced skills. If a trainer\u2019s clients are not testing\nthe limits of his knowledge, he is not doing a good enough job with them. The\nmaster trainer is eager and proud to have a student exceed his abilities but seeks\nto delay it by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the\nathlete\u2019s growth.\nBecause I want my clients\u2019 training experience to transcend the physical realm,\nI am obligated to understand their jobs, hobbies, families, and goals. Motivating\nclients to transcend fitness requires that I be involved in their lives. This is not go-\ning to happen without my being both interested in them and interesting to them.\nBeing a voracious reader of books, newspapers, and magazines, I have no short-\nage of conversation, ideas, and knowledge to share, and so you will find me at my\nclients\u2019 parties, weddings, and family gatherings. Indeed, I am a personal friend to\nnearly every one of my clients. This is extremely gratifying work and often emo-\ntionally charged, but that is all right because I am an integral part of my athletes\u2019\nlives, and life is full of laughter, tears, and hope.\nOur friendship, the fun we have, and the frequency of our contact, coupled with\nthe scope of fitness\u2019s impact and the technical merits of my training, contribute to"}

More than just the\nbackbone of CrossFit\u2019s strength and successes, it has been, we believe, the prima-\nry reason for our success.\nUsing this template, we built a practice that kept us both busy from roughly\n5 to 10 a.m. Monday through Saturday. That schedule produced a low-six-figure in-\ncome, which is really amazing given that we got to work together, with our friends,\nhaving a positive impact on people\u2019s lives, and keep afternoons free for family,\nrecreation, and study.\nTraining with the attention and commitment that we bring to our practice, though\nfun and immensely rewarding, is also draining, and five appointments per day is\nabout all we could handle without an unacceptable drop in energy, focus, and,\nconsequently, professional standards.\nEventually, the demand for our training exceeded the time we were professionally\nable or willing to allot. In an effort to accommodate more athletes, we began to\nhold group classes.\nWe had used group classes to train some of our athletic teams, and everyone\nloved them, trainers and athletes alike.

They also seem to have an inordinate\ndifficulty filling their classes.\nThis is exactly how we built our group classes. After working for years at the limit\nof our one-on-one capacity, we started accepting new clients by doubling them up\nwith other one-on-one clients to form one-on-two appointments.\nWe introduced the shift to group classes by telling the existing one-on-one clients\nthat we had good news for them: \u201cYour training rate is going to go down and we\u2019re\ngoing to introduce you to a new friend.\u201d Where there was resistance to sharing the\ntime we asked for a trial period.

Seeing builds on this knowledge by\nrequiring the trainer to assess these points of performance (and deviation from\nthem) in real time. Correcting is the ability to improve a client\u2019s mechanics to better\nadhere to the points of performance.\nEach movement has at least two sections: 1) Points of Performance; and 2) Com-\nmon Faults and Corrections.

Effectiveness can be assessed by asking whether clients optimize\nwork capacity across broad time and modal domains (i.e., whether a client becomes as fit and healthy as possible)\nA newer trainer may have only rudimentary capacity in each area and clients still will see results because of the\ninherent benefits of performing constantly varied functional movements at high intensity. An effective trainer, on\nthe other hand, has the ability to safeguard health and improve performance for a client beyond what he or she\ncould do alone.\nAlthough these areas can be described and defined independently (below), there is a natural overlap among them in\na real-time coaching environment. A deficiency in any one area can inhibit a trainer\u2019s success. Even a weakness in one\narea relative to the others blunts the trainer\u2019s overall reach. For example, a trainer with tremendous knowledge and\ntechnical skill (teaching, seeing, and correcting) will still have difficulty retaining members if there is little persona\nconnection with them (presence and attitude).\nRegardless of a trainer\u2019s current level of proficiency, a commitment to improving each area is the hallmark of a\nsuccessful trainer. Similar to the athlete\u2019s path to refining and improving movement mechanics, a trainer must refine\ncoaching skills across a career to become great. Doing so develops virtuosity in coaching.\nTEACHING\nThe ability to effectively articulate and instruct the mechanics of each movement, including the ability to focus on major\npoints of performance before more subtle or nuanced ones. It also includes the ability to change instruction based on\nthe athlete\u2019s needs and capacity.\nTo teach functional movements, a trainer must first understand what defines proper mechanics and what may cause\npoor movement. A trainer must know ideal positions, but more frequently a trainer\u2019s job is to teach athletes how to\nimprove poor positions and movement patterns.\nKnowledge in fitness-related areas\nBeyond movement mechanics, trainers can also instruct clients in other areas that may improve their fitness. Greater\nknowledge in any field that overlaps with fitness\u2014such as anatomy and physiology, nutrition, or even expertise in"}
{"239": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\na certain sport\u2014can aid a trainer\u2019s teaching. The more athletically advanced the athlete, the greater the depth of\nknowledge needed for a trainer to produce additional fitness gains. Continued research, education, and practical\nexperience over the course of a career develop a breadth of knowledge applicable to any athlete, from beginner to elite.\nTeaching demands not only possessing knowledge but also the ability to impart it to others. Knowledge alone does\nnot make one an effective teacher. Successful teaching hinges on a trainer\u2019s ability to accurately convey as much of\nthat knowledge as possible to others.\nEffective communication\nTo convey knowledge effectively, a teacher must be able to change his or her communication style to meet the\ncapacity of the student, regardless of his or her background, ability, and learning style. This is why trainers are\nbest served by using different means of communication\u2014visual and verbal teaching, for example\u2014to aid learning.\nImplicit in the trainer-athlete dialogue is the trainer taking responsibility for when communication with the athlete\nbreaks down. It is the trainer\u2019s responsibility to guide and lead the athlete, and it is the athlete\u2019s responsibility to be\ncommitted to the process. However, if the athlete is clearly frustrated with the instruction, the trainer must change\nstrategies or communication style until the athlete succeeds.\nA trainer can also assess the effectiveness of teaching and communication by determining whether the athlete meets\nperformance expectations. If no one in a group moves to the level the trainer expects, he or she needs to reevaluate\nthe instruction. It is often not the athlete\u2019s fault. A good teacher can use effective communication to prevent a large\npercentage of problems from occurring. For example, it is often effective to break complex movements down into\na progression or logical teaching steps that allow the athlete to practice pieces that naturally build on one another.\nA teacher who shows an athlete a barbell clean, describes it in its entirety, and then asks the class to replicate it can\nexpect few (if any) to match the instruction. Conversely, using a progression\u2014such as that demonstrated for the\nmedicine-ball clean at the Level 1 Course\u2014will get more athletes to demonstrate the gross mechanics quickly. These\nprogressions can often help a trainer focus on seeing certain faults as well.\nTeaching as much as is necessary often means the teacher must reduce and simplify his or her body of knowledge\nto the one or two most salient points at that moment for that particular athlete. With fast-paced human movement,\nchange is often hampered by long and detailed explanations when simple, broad-brush instructions are more digest-\nible. This does not mean a trainer\u2019s knowledge of the system should be simple; it is the explanation that should be.\nA trainer can ask himself or herself, \u201cWhat is the one thing this athlete needs right now?\u201d The answer will change as\nprogress is made.\nseeing\nThe ability to distinguish good from poor movement mechanics and identify both gross and subtle faults whether the\nathlete is in motion or static.\nA trainer who can effectively assess the mechanical positions as sound or unsound throughout movement has\ncapacity in seeing. Seeing is the necessary first step for a trainer to bring about change in a client\u2019s mechanics, but it\nrests on one\u2019s teaching capacity (knowledge). Trainers must first know positions of best mechanical leverage, as well\nas the effect of varying anthropometrics on these positions. If a trainer does not know what to look for, he or she will\nnot see correctible issues."}
{"240": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nStatic faults\nThe trainer must also use visual-recognition skills throughout the repetition, whether the athlete is static or dynamic\nStatic positions are the points at which the athlete is not moving, even briefly. Static positions usually occur near\nthe end ranges of motion\u2014either in the starting, receiving, or finishing positions\u2014or when there is a brief pause or\ndecreased speed, often due to a change of direction. Static positions include the setup position for a deadlift or the\nbottom of a squat, for example. Correctly identifying faults is easier in static positions because these positions give\ntrainers more time for assessment.\nDynamic faults\nDynamic positions find the athlete moving between the static positions, often at high speed. Examples of faults\nseen in dynamic movements include not reaching full hip extension in the drive phase of a clean, pressing early in a\npush press, or initiating the squat with the knees. These dynamic faults are more difficult to identify because of the\ndecreased time for assessment. The trainer must also know when and where to see faults during the movement. For\nexample, a trainer needs to see that the athlete has the weight on the heels during the drive phase of a push jerk\nbut the trainer is also evaluating the trunk-to-femur relationship for hip extension, the bar path relative to the fronta\nplane, and a whole host of other relationships. Generally, a profile view of the athlete (offset by about 45 degrees)\nis the most useful view to assess the athlete\u2019s mechanics, but trainers should not be limited to using this view only.\nThe difficulty in seeing dynamic faults increases as:\n1. the athlete moves more quickly, and\n2. the faults become more subtle.\nYears of experience help a trainer effectively coach any level of athlete. New trainers may use a few methods to\ndevelop their ability to see faults, particularly dynamic faults. One method is to study film. Slow the movement down\nto a series of static frames. A trainer may choose to film his or her own athletes or simply watch footage available\non the internet. Replaying the footage in real time after observing the movement in a static series can help bridge\nthe gap between seeing static and dynamic positions. Another strategy for newer trainers is to methodically survey\nathletes for only one fault at a time. For example, when teaching athletes the push jerk, the trainer may choose to\nwatch only for hip extension during the first several repetitions. Then, the trainer may choose to watch and see if\nthe athletes drive through their heels. Over time, trainers can observe multiple faults simultaneously (e.g., lack of hip\nextension or not having the weight on the heels), but initially, trying to see everything often results in seeing nothing\nSimilarly, newer trainers generally find more success by watching one athlete at a time per repetition instead of\nscanning multiple athletes with every repetition.\nCorreCTing\nThe ability to facilitate better mechanics for an athlete using visual, verbal, and/or tactile cues. This includes the ability\nto triage (prioritize) faults in order of importance, which requires an understanding of how multiple faults are related.\nThe ability of a trainer to facilitate improved mechanics is dependent on capacities in teaching and seeing. Teaching\nreflects a trainer\u2019s knowledge of proper mechanics; seeing reflects a trainer\u2019s ability to discern these positions in rea\ntime. If capacity is limited in either, it follows that the trainer\u2019s capacity in correcting will also be weak.\nCorrecting mechanics results in both increased performance gains and decreased risk of injury. A trainer can expect\nto correct an athlete\u2019s mechanics forever; mechanics can be infinitely refined to create ever more efficient positions"}
{"241": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nas the athlete progresses. CrossFit trainers should strive for excellent mechanics in their clients and avoid settling for\n\u201cOK\u201d movement. This means a trainer must be able to correct both gross and subtle deviations in all levels of athletes\nThey must set a high standard for good movement and be relentless in the constant pursuit of improvement.\nCorrecting hinges on the trainer\u2019s ability to:\n1. use successful cues,\n2. know multiple corrections for each fault,\n3. triage faulty movement, and\n4. balance critique with praise.\nCues\nAny cue that results in improved movement mechanics is successful and therefore a good cue. There are no specific\nformulas, formats, or rules to follow for cues, and their value is based on the result. A cue\u2019s primary function is to\nhelp the athlete execute perfect mechanics, not to perfectly describe the mechanics of the movement. For example\none may say \u201cweight in heels\u201d to help a person shift weight back and better achieve pressure across the foot (versus\non the toes). Generally, making cues short, specific, and actionable tends to result in a greater success rate. Short\nspecific, and actionable cues are useful because the trainer gives a single task for the athlete to complete. An example\nof this type of cue is, \u201cPush your knees out.\u201d It is short (four words), specific to a body part (knees), and also indicates\naction and/or direction (out). It is easy for the athlete to respond to a cue such as this, even when performing a com-\nplicated movement.\nIt is possible for a trainer to confuse cueing with fault identification. For example, pointing out the fault that is pres-\nent\u2014\u201cYour knees are caving in\u201d\u2014does not tell the athlete how to fix it. An experienced athlete may be able to make\nthe leap from hearing the identification of the fault to then fixing it, but this translation from fault identification to\nspecific direction is ultimately the trainer\u2019s responsibility.\nTrainers may also rely on more technical language in their cues (i.e., \u201cYou are losing your midline\u201d), which assumes the\nathlete has a significant amount of fitness-related knowledge. While such language may give the appearance of being\nmore technical (and perhaps represents an attempt to sound more intelligent), it is at best a vague verbal cue. Cues\nshould be kept to simple language that is easily understood by anyone. Non-specific language is also best avoided\nin cues. Something such as, \u201cGet tight!\u201d or \u201cChest!\u201d can be meaningless to the athlete, especially in the absence of\ninstruction on how to \u201cget tight\u201d or where and how to move the chest.\nA basic three-step process for developing short, specific, and actionable cues is:\n1. identify the fault,\n2. identify what is out of place (be specific: name the body part), and\n3. give direction to that body part.\nAs stated before, \u201cPush your knees out\u201d is a short, specific, and actionable cue.\nHowever, even with short, specific, and actionable cues, there is no guarantee the athlete\u2019s movement will improve\nThe trainer needs to use multiple cues until the fault is resolved. There are cases in which a cue that is effective for\none athlete is ineffective for another, and in other cases, even a good cue may result in poor movement. \u201cGet your"}

Nevertheless, some athletes interpret this cue to mean that the weight should be on their heels exclusively\nand they fall backwards or lose their balance. That does not mean the cue was bad or the trainer was wrong; it means\nthe trainer has to try an alternative cue.\nA trainer should not be limited to a certain set of cues for a specific fault, and he or she should continue to use differ-\nent cues until the movement improves. Over time, a trainer develops corrective strategies, building a bank of options\nfor every fault. These corrective strategies should include verbal (i.e., speaking), visual (i.e., showing), and tactile\n(i.e., touching) cues, all of which may be employed to fix the same fault but may be interpreted differently among\nathletes. Verbal cues tell the athlete a specific instruction, visual cues create contrasting images between current and\npreferred positioning, and tactile cues use physical targets to achieve proper mechanics. The greater the number of\nstrategies a trainer can employ for any fault, the more likely it is that he or she will be successful in correcting the fault\nTriaging faults\nDetermining which single fault to correct can be a challenge, as multiple faults often occur together. Ideally, every\nfault would be addressed simultaneously, but this is unrealistic in practice. The trainer is best served by triaging\nfaults. The term \u201ctriaging\u201d is most often used in medicine to assign urgency to those needing medical attention\nTriaging when coaching movement means assigning urgency to the multiple faults present in order of the most to\nleast important. Greater importance is assigned to faults that have the highest risk for injury (and, therefore, also the\ngreatest potential to limit performance). In a loaded environment, there are many cases in which the fault to address\nfirst would be loss of a neutral spine, usually in flexion. However, a flexed lumbar curve at depth in an air squat is less\nconcerning than that same position in a loaded back squat. This athlete needs to continue to air squat to full depth\nfighting for a neutral midline, all while maintaining the range of motion required by life. It is precisely the practice of\nthe movement, even with less-than-ideal mechanics, that will eventually allow him or her to reclaim positions that\ncan be loaded. In this example, completing the full range of motion was given more priority than midline stabilization\nThe ordering is based on the severity of the deviation from the ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task\nthere is no single ordering of faults that can be used across all athletes in all applications.\nWhichever fault the trainer decides to fix first should become the trainer\u2019s focus. He or she has to selectively ignore\nthe other faults present. Once that fault is fixed or mitigated at least to the degree that it is no longer the most import-\nant, the trainer can move on to the next issue.\nAfter choosing which fault to address, the trainer needs to know how the various faults are related. A trainer may\ncue a different body part than the one he or she is trying to fix due to the interrelatedness of movement mechanics\nSuppose an athlete performs an air squat with the following faults: weight shifting forward, knees collapsing, and\nback rounding. The trainer needs to consider: Are the caving knees causing the back to round? Is the rounded back\ncausing the weight to shift forward? Perhaps the trainer chooses to address the back position first but actually tells\nthe athlete, \u201cPush the knees out.\u201d There are cases in which allowing more room for the pelvis helps create a neutra\nspine position.\nAssess the cue\u2019s effectiveness and provide feedback\nAfter a trainer delivers a cue, he or she must stay with that athlete for at least another repetition to assess the result\nWhatever the athlete\u2019s response, the trainer needs to provide feedback. A trainer needs to let the athlete know if\nthe movement was the same, better, or worse. If the movement improves, a trainer needs to acknowledge that"}
{"243": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nperhaps with, \u201cThat\u2019s better\u201d or, \u201cGood correction.\u201d This helps the athlete develop kinesthetic awareness of proper\npositioning. In some cases, an athlete may improve movement but not to the desired degree. Encouraging these\nathletes simply to give more in that same direction is often a sound strategy (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s better, but even lower!\u201d). If\nthe movement has not changed, this could be addressed simply by saying, \u201cNot there yet\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019ll come back to you,\u201d\nfor example. An unsuccessful cue should not be repeated multiple times with a single athlete; instead, the trainer\nshould find a new cue. If the movement changes for the worse, the trainer also needs to immediately recognize this\nand stop or reverse it (e.g., \u201cOther way\u201d).\nNot staying to assess the effectiveness of a cue and provide the athlete with feedback is almost the same as not\ngiving a cue at all. If a trainer tells an athlete to do something and walks away before seeing the result, he or she may\nmiss it when a cue results in no change or even change for the worse. The athlete has no idea if his or her efforts\nhave resulted in improvement. All feedback, positive and negative, is tied to the athlete developing better kinesthetic\nawareness. Precision of word choice is critical. The use of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d needs to be reserved for actual sound or\nimproved mechanics and not used as a filler.\nThroughout the cueing process, a trainer must also be aware when praise for hard work (regardless of change) is\nnecessary. There are cases where no change or only a very slight change occurs in a session. Celebrating the effort\nacknowledges the hard work put forth that day and helps a client remain willing to continue to work hard. A trainer\njust needs to be clear when the praise is for the effort rather than a movement that still needs improvement.\ngrouP ManageMenT\nThe ability to organize and manage, both at a micro level (within each class) and at the macro level (the gym as a\nwhole). This includes managing time well; organizing the space, equipment, and participants for optimal flow and\nexperience; planning ahead; etc.\nGroup management is not just about organizing logistical considerations for a class so clients have enough space\ntime, and equipment to complete the workout. It is about optimally managing these variables to support the best\npossible instruction (see \u201cComponents of an Effective Class\u201d). Poor planning of any aspect of a class\u2014for example\nthe amount of time spent on certain parts, how the equipment is set up, and how much time is allotted to each par-\nticipant\u2014can detract from the quality of the experience.\nAdhere to the schedule\nAt its most basic level, effective group management means adhering to posted schedules. Clients plan their sched-\nules around these announced times, and it should not be assumed that they have more time or flexibility. Adhering\nto posted times means both starting and ending on time: Running over is as unacceptable as starting late. Ending\nlate usually occurs when a trainer does not plan ahead and think through the entire class schedule. Adhering to the\nschedule also includes the schedule within each class. Following a simple template (such as introduction, warm-up\nworkout, and post-workout) every class helps ensure necessary time is devoted to each piece (see \u201cComponents of\nan Effective Class\u201d). The trainer may also consider the experience level of the class to determine which pieces need\nmore time or less time during instruction.\nSpace and equipment layout\nGroup management also includes variables such as space layout and equipment availability. The layout needs to\naccount for buffer zones around any equipment in use and should also take into account when athletes have to move"}
{"244": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nto different areas of the gym during the workout. The class size often dictates which workouts are realistic given the\nequipment and space. Even in cases in which neither is limited, an effective trainer should have pre-determined alter-\nnatives for any class workout should a larger number of participants show up unexpectedly.\nGroup management speaks to the trainer\u2019s ability to reduce the logistical setup and preparation time during a class to\nmaximize the amount of teaching and movement time. This means the trainer plans ahead and perhaps prearranges\na complicated workout with multiple pieces of equipment and/or weights. Spending several or more minutes sorting\nequipment takes away from a trainer\u2019s time to instruct, improve, and refine movement.\nPlan how and what to teach\nTime spent on instruction can also reduce the client\u2019s practice time. A trainer needs to plan how and what to teach to\nmaximize the client\u2019s time moving. Allowing for enough practice time every class is necessary for both the trainer and\nclient. Less practice time gives the trainer less time to observe and cue movement mechanics, as well as less time for\na client to work on movement with improved form. Change in mechanics comes from continual cueing across many\nrepetitions.\nDuring every class, the trainer also needs to manage the attention given to each participant. Every student should\nfeel that he or she received enough attention. While some clients need more time than others, even good movers\nwith subtle inefficiencies need to be coached, pushed for higher speed and/or loads, or praised for sound perfor-\nmance. Attention still benefits them. To assist with each client getting enough individual attention, a helpful tool is\nto keep the group on the trainer\u2019s cadence for all repetitions during the warm-up or skill work. Controlling when the\ngroup moves ensures the same number of repetitions are completed by everyone. It also allows the trainer to sys-\ntematically and selectively observe individuals and specific aspects of their movement.\nThe size of the class affects how much time a trainer can spend with each person, but the class size should not be\nbeyond the trainer\u2019s capacity. The demands of large classes often turn trainers into crowd herders, timekeepers and\ncheerleaders who have little time to spend on cueing individual movement faults. Newer trainers (those with less\nthan two years of experience) can rarely find success when stepping into classes of 10-plus participants. In his article\n\u201cScaling Professional Training,\u201d CrossFit Founder Greg Glassman explained that after years of one-on-one persona\ntraining produced groups of two, eventually groups of three, and so on, his classes continued to grow until growth\nresulted in \u201cperceived reduction in attention\u201d to each paying member.\nRegardless of experience, trainers should make an honest assessment of the time and attention given to each client\nafter each training session.

If the answer to either question is no, the session was likely too large for the trainer\nThe goal is to maximize a trainer\u2019s effectiveness and reach.\nPresenCe and aTTiTude\nThe ability to create a positive and engaging learning environment, showing empathy for athletes and creating rapport\n\u201cPresence and attitude\u201d refers to the trainer\u2019s ability to create a positive atmosphere and develop a rapport with each\nclient. Although more subjective than the other five areas of effective training, developing a positive presence and\nattitude is equally if not more important."}
{"245": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nKnow your clients\nAn effective trainer recognizes that each person has different abilities, insecurities, needs, and goals; he or she also\nhas the awareness and interpersonal skills to respond accordingly. The trainer recognizes that individuals respond\ndifferently to instruction and critique and makes it his or her responsibility to determine how best to relate to and\nmotivate each individual regardless of background and ability.\nA trainer must be aware of whether each client is interested in each class; a client\u2019s needs may change with the days\nand external life demands. The trainer should know what is happening with most of the group most of the time, and\nthis goes beyond movement mechanics. This includes issues such as who is struggling that day due to external pres-\nsures or stress, who has high energy, who is aloof or annoyed, who is new to the gym, etc. All these factors may affect\nthe degree to which the athletes can perform relative to their usual capacity. Effective trainers know these things\nbecause they routinely interact with their clients and are invested in their relationships with them.\nA common trait of trainers with a positive presence and attitude is that they genuinely care about their clients\u2019 success\nThis care means more to clients than the trainer\u2019s knowledge. Many clients have little interest in the technical aspects\nof training. Their interests often lie in unrelated professions and hobbies, and they are at the gym to improve the\nquality of their lives. The mechanisms of their success in the gym are much less important to them than the results\nand success itself. In addition to seeing results, clients know if they feel welcomed and cared for, respected, inspired\nand motivated. They can sense whether the trainer has their best interests at heart.\nBe authentic\nA positive presence and attitude cannot be faked; it comes from a sincere passion for service. It can take on many\nforms based on the trainer\u2019s personality and interpersonal skills. Trainers should not interpret this as being any single\ntrait, such as loud, funny, or bubbly. Trainers are encouraged to be authentic. There is room for any personality type\nto succeed if a trainer couples genuine caring with awareness of his or her limitations and recognizes the effect he\nor she may have on clients. This may motivate a trainer to become a better version of himself or herself. A trainer\nmay set personal goals to compensate for any perceived shortcomings. For example, a trainer who is perceived as\nreserved may make an effort to be at class early to welcome and greet each member.\nNewer trainers especially may be shy or nervous in front of a group, and this may blunt their presence and attitude\nSmall mechanical changes, such as eye contact, open body language, and smiling, can go a long way toward putting\nthe trainer\u2019s best foot forward. Trainers might try asking clients simple questions about well-being and then really\nlistening and following up about their answers. These are basic interpersonal skills trainers can initially rely on unti\nthey become more comfortable and engaged with their clients.\ndeMonsTraTion\nThe ability to provide athletes with an accurate visual example of the movement at hand. A trainer may do this using\nhimself or herself as an example or by choosing another athlete to provide the example. This requires a strong aware-\nness of one\u2019s own movement mechanics. It also includes the concept of leading by example; a trainer should follow his\nor her own advice and be an inspiration to clients.\nProvide a visual aid\nDemonstration is a powerful visual tool to aid a trainer\u2019s instruction.

This requires a trainer to adjust demonstrations depend-\ning on the group and its needs. Just like teaching, demonstration may have to be made more simple and obvious\nthan realistic and subtle to meet the needs of the trainees. In cases in which a trainer\u2019s mechanics are limited, using\nothers for demonstration is perfectly acceptable. Trainers who have the capacity to discern good movement patterns\nquickly do not have a problem finding an effective substitute.\nDemonstrate credibility\nDemonstration also covers whether a trainer demonstrates to others that he or she ascribes to the program that is\nrecommended and holds himself or herself to the same standards and values expected of clients. Demonstration\nmore broadly speaks to the trainer\u2019s credibility. Leading by example has a large influence on the culture created at\nthe trainer\u2019s gym. A trainer can ask: How do I get my clients to care about technique? To push themselves harder? To\nadhere to workout standards? To treat each other with respect? Many answers can be provided by examining a train-\ner\u2019s own attitude and actions. The trainer needs to work on improved technique, use high intensity, follow the same\nprogram, follow the range-of-motion standards, count repetitions correctly, support and encourage others, etc.\nThis means a trainer can utilize his or her own firsthand experiences with diet strategies, workout programs, com-\npetition scenarios, etc. to address clients\u2019 questions and help them reach their goals. Insight and advice are best\ndelivered when they are the result of experience.

An effective trainer must\nhave capacity in each area, and a trainer\u2019s effectiveness is limited by capacity in each. A professional trainer contin-\nues to develop capacity in each area across his or her entire career. This is chasing virtuosity in coaching. \u201cDoing the\ncommon uncommonly well\u201d does not only apply to movement; it can apply to any particular skill.

{"249": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nCOMMON MOVEMENT THEMES FOR FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS\ninTroduCTion\nThere are common movement themes displayed in all foundational movements, from the nine foundational move-\nments in the Level 1 Course to others such as the snatch, kipping pull-up, and handstand push-up. These movement\nthemes broadly categorize similar positions and movement patterns, whether the athlete is static (starting, receiving\nor finishing positions) or dynamic (moving between static positions).\nThese themes are:\n\u2022 midline stabilization,\n\u2022 core-to-extremity movement,\n\u2022 balance about the frontal plane,\n\u2022 posterior-chain engagement,\n\u2022 sound hip function,\n\u2022 active shoulders,\n\u2022 full range of motion about a joint, and\n\u2022 effective stance and/or grip.\nUnderstanding these themes and the contexts in which to apply them will give trainers the general principles for eval-\nuating movement. There are positions or movement patterns that do not fit neatly into these categories, as well as\nmovements that do not demonstrate all the themes. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. It is simply a classification\ntool that can be used to aid development of one\u2019s coaching skill set.\nThese themes are exemplified when an athlete performs a movement correctly (i.e., adhering to the points of per-\nformance). The movement themes increase the potential for improved performance and minimize the risk of injury\nSound mechanics aid performance and risk management by using positions with the best mechanical and muscular\nalignment, conferring safety, efficacy, and efficiency simultaneously.\nMidLine sTabiLiZaTion\nA \u201cmidline\u201d is a plane of bilateral symmetry, but it is used in CrossFit to specifically refer to the relationship of the\nspine (base of the head to the top of the hips) and pelvis during functional movement. The midline trisects the spine\nand bisects the pelvis when the two are in their neutral anatomical relationship. Stabilization means something has\nbeen made stable, or \u201cstatic.\u201d Midline stabilization refers to the athlete\u2019s capacity to prevent movement from this\nneutral spinal position and is synonymous with core strength. Midline stabilization determines whether the athlete\ncan maintain the natural S-curve of the spine to the pelvis when dynamic and/or loaded. Some lifting applications\nrely on a midline posture with some extension past neutral in both the lumbar and thoracic regions. Regardless, this\nposture is maintained throughout the movement.\nStabilization of the spine is largely accomplished by engaging the abdominals (\u201cabs\u201d), internal and external oblique\nmuscles (\u201cobliques\u201d), and erector spinae (\u201cspinal erectors\u201d or simply \u201cerectors\u201d). Engaging the abs helps engage the\nspinal erectors and obliques; together, they create a belt of musculature around the vertebrae."}
{"250": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nTorso as a rigid, integrated structure\nThis neutral, static position maximizes performance because moving the torso as one rigid, integrated structure\nenables the transmission of force between the appendages and the object being lifted. In a push jerk, for example\nthe legs and hips extend force upward into the weight through the torso. A soft midline does not allow for the optima\ntransfer of force to the bar.\nWhen maintaining a neutral spine, the orientation of the vertebrae results in favorable distribution of forces and\nreduces the risk for injury. Where possible, it is ideal to have the midline in a vertical orientation because of the optima\nmuscular and skeletal alignment for force distribution (e.g., in a squat). As the torso moves from a vertical orientation\nas in the deadlift, the demand on the musculature to maintain a neutral spine increases. Forward movement of the\ntorso, however, does not increase the risk of injury if midline stabilization is present. It is when midline stabilization\nis lost that the shear force experienced by the spine increases. The human spine is more susceptible to injury when\nexposed to shear (vs. compression) forces. The resulting shear force attempts to push one vertebra past another\nwhile muscles and ligaments resist this loss of positioning. If the muscles and ligaments are not strong enough, an\ninjury to the spine may occur.\nDeviations from neutral\nDeviations from neutral may occur in flexion (bending forward from neutral) or extension (bending backward from\nneutral). Recall that a natural function of the abdominals is to flex the spine, so spinal flexion by itself is not nec-\nessarily problematic (e.g., getting out of bed) and is potentially beneficial to reduce the lever arm (e.g., gymnastics\nholds). Similarly, the erectors extend the spine. Extending past neutral is not inherently dangerous but can become\nso depending on degree of deviation and the load on the body.\nThe following hierarchy of spinal positioning is listed in order of increasing risk for injury:\n\u2022 Safest: Midline stabilization in a neutral position.\n\u2022 More risky: A non-neutral spine in a static position. Although less ideal than midline stabilization in\na neutral position, static positions (flexed or extended) prevent movement of the individual spinal\nsegments. This means no individual vertebra bears the majority of the lifting force.\n\u2022 Most risky: Loss of a neutral spine during movement, specifically when starting from neutral and moving\nto significant spinal flexion. This is potentially the most injurious, as there is movement of the individual\nspinal segments and one or a few vertebra(e) bear the majority of the lifting force.\nThe most common injury from a loss of midline stabilization occurs when the lumbar spine (L1\u2013L5) flexes under\nload, changing the normal concave curvature of the lower back to convex. Typically, flexion of the spine is seen with\nincreased hip flexion or when the midline is resisting a load on the front side of the body, as in a deadlift.\nAthletes may also deviate from neutral by overextending or hyperextending the spine, which means significantly\nbending backward from neutral into an injurious range of motion. There is a difference between the natural S-curva-\nture of the spine and an exaggerated extension of the spine. Placing athletes in an overextended position does not\nincrease the benefits of a neutral spine and may place them at risk for injury.\nHyperextension can result in the same injuries as excessive flexion (i.e., disc herniation or damage to facet joints)\nHyperextension generally occurs with more flexible athletes or occasionally with more advanced athletes. Over-"}
{"251": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nextension or hyperextension often points to a lack of engagement of the abdominals and can generally be addressed\nby cueing an athlete to tighten the abs. It is most often seen when an athlete lifts overhead.\nCORE-TO-EXTREMITY MOVEMENT\nCore-to-extremity movements demonstrate a sequence of muscular contraction that begins with the large force-pro-\nducing, low-velocity muscles of the core (abdominals and spinal erectors) and hips, and ends with the small force-pro-\nducing, high-velocity muscles of the extremities (e.g., biceps, calves, wrist flexors). Core-to-extremity movement\nbegins with establishing midline stabilization for effective force transfer\u2014i.e., a base is created and force radiates\nfrom there. This muscular patterning teaches the athlete to fluidly transmit power from one area of the body to\nanother. Core-to-extremity movement maximizes performance because it tasks the largest musculature to generate\nforce first, allowing the greatest forces to develop. This sequence improves efficiency and allows the greatest amount\nof work to be accomplished.\nCore-to-extremity movements are less risky than movements that violate this pattern because the largest muscles\nare tasked with generating the most force. Smaller muscle groups and associated tendons and ligaments are more\nsusceptible to injury, such as tearing, when exposed to loading designed for larger movers.\nCore-to-extremity movements are found everywhere, not just with movements that involve the arms and legs, so\nfaults can show up everywhere. Even a shoulder press or a deadlift may not effectively demonstrate core-to-extrem-\nity movement absent a stable midline. For dynamic faults, core-to-extremity violations occur when there is incorrect\ntiming and the arms move before the hips and legs have extended (i.e., pulling or pushing early).\nBALANCE ABOUT THE FRONTAL PLANE\nThe frontal plane divides the athlete into anterior and posterior halves. It is the plane about which one is balanced\nand it bisects the athlete at mid-foot. Referencing the athlete\u2019s movement (i.e., his or her line of action) and the object\nhe or she is moving relative to the frontal plane can often determine the athlete\u2019s efficiency.\nSignificant deviations of the athlete and/or object forward of the frontal plane prevent successful task completion\nespecially as the loading increases. These deviations can also impair other points of performance (i.e., neutral spine\nweight on the heels). Generally, moving an object along straight lines (i.e., in the frontal plane) can increase perfor-\nmance by increasing efficiency as the object follows the shortest distance between two points. Note, however, the\nathlete\u2019s movement accommodates the object and may or may not be characterized by straight lines. For example\nin a movement such as the squat, an effective line of action is created when the hips sit back and down as the knees\nbend. In this manner, the athlete is best able to keep the weight on the heels, and when the squat is loaded, the bar\ntravels along the shortest line. This movement also can reduce excessive force at the patella, which may occur if the\nknees translate excessively forward (i.e., such that the heels come up).\nBalance about the frontal plane can also be referenced in a kipping pull-up, where the plane is formed along the\nline from the hands to the floor. The athlete is most efficient when the center of mass oscillates about this plane to\nmaintain the most efficient timing of the swing. In the kipping pull-up, when the center of mass deviates from the\nfrontal plane too much, the athlete loses timing and has to reset the swing.\nA lack of balance about the frontal plane may increase the risk for injury because of increased potential for other\nmovement errors. For example, if the chest drops in a front squat with the bar deviating forward of the fronta"}

However, a violation of balance about the frontal plane by itself is not\nterribly risky.\nPOSTERIOR-CHAIN ENGAGEMENT\nThe posterior chain includes the group of muscles, tendons, and ligaments on the posterior (back) of the body, which\ncontains the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), gluteal muscles (\u201cglutes\u201d), and spina\nerectors. \u201cEngagement\u201d means this musculature contributes to the movement. Posterior-chain engagement does not\nrefer to using the posterior chain in an attempt to exclude the anterior chain. Ideally, there is a balance of pressure\nbetween the balls of the feet and the heels, with the line of action at the frontal plane. Posterior-chain engagement\nalso enables the athlete to maintain optimal knee alignment with the foot.\nInclusion of this large set of musculature on the backside of the body maximizes performance because of the\nincreased power generation, thereby resulting in faster speed to completion or increased load lifted. Keeping the\nheels rooted brings the load closer to the frontal plane, which helps the athlete stay balanced and drive the load up\nnot forward. This increases efficiency. Engagement of the spinal erectors is also essential for maintaining midline\nstabilization and providing the strongest base to transmit forces.\nFinally, engagement of the posterior chain helps keep the knees in line with the toes, where there is the best mechan-\nical position of leverage between the upper and lower leg. With posterior-chain engagement, greater musculature is\nrecruited to move the load, and enough room is created for full range of motion in a squatting movement. When the\nknees collapse inward, the center of pressure shifts forward (given the angle at which the knees flex). This positioning\nis often a result of underdeveloped external rotators of the hip.\nPosterior-chain engagement contributes to safety because it promotes midline stabilization and balance about the\nfrontal plane. Also, keeping the knees in line with the toes reduces lateral and rotational forces at the knee joint\nThese forces are problematic for a hinge joint such as the knee, where associated tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and\nmenisci could be damaged when poor mechanics are allowed to go unchanged over long periods of time. It is less\nlikely that a single repetition causes significant damage to the joints, but thousands of repetitions performed over\ntime can wear on the knees\u2019 structural integrity.\nPressure in the feet\nA lack of posterior-chain engagement results in the athlete (and/or object) shifting excessively forward of the fronta\nplane. A trainer can see this by observing the center of pressure in the feet in all movements, especially with any knee\nor hip flexion. This may or may not occur in conjunction with the heel coming off the floor. The heel can remain on the\nground while the center of pressure shifts forward.\nThis may also indicate premature shifting of weight to the toes, especially during an explosive hip extension, which\nresults in the hip extending forward rather than upward. If an athlete jumps forward during a lift, it may be an indica-\ntion of a premature shift of weight to the toes. \u201cTriple extension\u201d is not a forced calf raise in conjunction with exten-\nsion of the knees and hips; it is achieved when the heels leave the ground because of, and after, a violent extension\nthereby creating extension of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Analysis of elite lifters shows that the longer a lifter\nremains in contact with the ground during the second pull, the greater the acceleration on the bar. Greater surface\narea in contact with the ground enables a greater force to be transferred."}
{"253": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nKnee position\nWith regard to knee position, although there are two directions the knees can travel to come out of alignment with\nthe feet (laterally or medially), the fault is usually seen when the knees collapse inward (medially). The degree of devi-\nation in knee alignment generally increases with increased hip and knee flexion in a movement and/or wider stances\nAn athlete with a poor knee position in any movement often produces the error to some degree any time the knee\nflexes. For example, an athlete whose knees collapse in a squat is likely to have the knees collapse to a less obvious\ndegree in running, box jumps, push presses, etc.\nSOUND HIP FUNCTION\nSound hip function refers to the athlete\u2019s ability to flex and extend the hip to maximize its contribution to a move-\nment. The hamstrings and glutes are powerful hip extensors. Powerful and complete hip extension is necessary for\nelite athletic capacity because:\n1. it applies the most force on the object, and\n2. it creates the most elevation on the object, giving the athlete the most time to accommodate or receive it.\nThere are no major safety issues with slow or incomplete hip extension.\nPoor hip function is usually expressed in one of three ways:\n1. muted hip,\n2. lack of hip extension, and/or\n3. slow hip extension.\nA muted hip never closes/flexes (and therefore is a \u201cpermanently\u201d open hip). If the hip never closes, the movement is\npredominantly driven by the quadriceps. The quadriceps extend the knee without contribution from the hamstrings\nand glutes. Lack of hip extension does not allow the power of the hamstrings and glutes to be fully expressed. This\ndoes not effectively put acceleration on the bar or object and therefore does not elevate it to any significant degree\nEven small deviations from full hip extension result in reduced power transmission. The speed of hip extension\nplays a critical role in accelerating the object being lifted, particularly when the object must be elevated far beyond\nits starting point (e.g., from rack to overhead). In all cases, the power of the musculature of the hips is not opti-\nmally expressed.\nACTIVE SHOULDERS\nAn active shoulder provides the most stable position for the shoulder when working against a load. This means an\nactive shoulder is present in the overhead lifts as well as the deadlift series, including the deadlift, sumo deadlift high\npull, and medicine-ball clean. Outside the nine foundational movements, active shoulders are found in the kipping\npull-up, ring dip, handstand push-up, row, and snatch, among other movements.\nActive shoulders are about scapular position and stabilization and require different actions by the athlete, depend-\ning on the movement. In each movement, the athlete attempts to keep the shoulder in a relatively neutral, natura\nposition, without yielding to a load. At the same time, he or she will create enough space between the anatomica\nstructures of the shoulder so they may pass freely without impingement. Typically, this means an athlete demon-\nstrates an active shoulder by applying force in the direction opposite the load. For example, in an overhead squat, the\nathlete pushes up on the barbell. In a push-up, the athlete pushes down into the ground. In a row, the athlete pulls"}
{"254": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nback to prevent the rounding of the shoulders. There are also cases in which an active shoulder is not achieved by\npushing into the load (e.g., bench press). In all cases, the retraction, elevation, etc. is not taken to the end range that\nresults in a contrived position. For example, retraction in a deadlift is not full retraction that may result in a loss of\nmidline stabilization or a position that would not be possible under any real load.\nAn active shoulder creates optimal skeletal alignment, which enables the most musculature of the torso (e.g., tra-\npezius) to aid in the stability of the shoulder and potentiate the greatest force. An active shoulder also moves the\nacromion process out of the way of the humerus, reducing the chance for impingement of the biceps tendons and\nrotator-cuff muscles. The chances for impingement increase as the grip narrows. In an overhead squat, for example\na wider grip requires less elevation to create clearance space.\nWhen an athlete loses an active shoulder, the direction the shoulders move (e.g., forward, down) depends on the\nmovement. The coach needs to observe from where the force is being applied and determine if the shoulders are\nmoving in that same direction (e.g., yielding).\nfuLL range of MoTion abouT a JoinT\nFull range of motion about a joint describes the natural anatomical beginning and end positions of a movement. Ful\nrange of motion allows a greater complement of musculature to be used (e.g., reaching full depth in a squat, using\nactive shoulders) and in some cases better mechanical advantage (e.g., bar resting on the body in the front rack)\nJoint safety is maximized by preserving the range of motion required by life while best distributing forces at any one\njoint or throughout a series of joints. Additionally, increasing the musculature and joints involved allows the athlete\nto develop the neuromuscular coordination that is universally found in compound movements and sport.\nToward the other extreme, hyperextension or artificially trying to create more range of motion past a joint\u2019s natura\nanatomical function can be detrimental to joint health; more is not always better.\nTraining to the full range of motion in functional movements best prepares an individual for any conceivable task\nWhile life\u2019s tasks may not always require full range of motion, training to the limits of one\u2019s natural end range prevents\ndeficiencies if and when the joints need to move the full range. Using full range of motion preserves joint health, flex-\nibility, and strength, reducing the chance of injury and decrepitude later in life. If there is not a more pressing safety\nissue that needs to be fixed first, a trainer needs to preserve full range of motion above much else (e.g., adding load\nincreasing speed).\neffeCTive sTanCe and/or griP\nThis refers to the foot and hand positions adopted during a movement, where the optimal stance and grip promote\ntask accomplishment and the ability to display all the movement\u2019s points of performance.\nThere are two common stances in CrossFit. A narrower stance (hip width) is used in the deadlifts, presses, and the\nOlympic lifts. The hip-width stance promotes a more direct transfer of force through the heels/floor and into the\nobject being moved. A wider stance (shoulder width) is used in squatting movements, allowing for greater depth\nand contribution of the posterior chain. Some force-transfer efficiency may be lost with the wider stance (relative to\nhip width), but function and range of motion are gained. It is possible to take a different stance to allow for different\nloading mechanics. For example, a wider stance is adopted in the sumo deadlift. This allows the torso to remain more\nupright, allowing the legs and hips to more readily assist the back during the lift."}
{"255": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nThe grip is usually outside the shoulders or hips so as not to interfere with the object or other points of performance\nbut it may also be wider if the demands of the movement require it. For example, the grip in the deadlift should\nbe wide enough so as not to interfere with the legs, but it is significantly wider in the snatch to reduce the overal\ndistance the bar must travel.\nIn many real-life applications with odd objects, a wider stance or narrower grip may be used. It is critical for athletes\nto learn how to apply the other points of performance, regardless of the stance and grip used to accommodate an\nobject. This is especially true of preparing an athlete for situations outside the gym, when a more convenient stance\nand grip are not always possible.\nThere are no major safety concerns from a lack of effective stance or grip except when other points of performance\nare adversely affected. The value of any stance and grip adjustment should be assessed based upon its effect on al\nthe other points of performance in the movement.\nASSESSING SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE\nSimply observing an athlete\u2019s position in a movement does not provide enough of a context to assess safety risk and\nperformance benefit. Both are assessed in light of the individual\u2019s:\n1. athletic capacity,\n2. loading,\n3. positioning, and\n4. speed of execution.\nA trainer cannot identify bad positions without this greater context. Decreased performance and increased injury are\nmore likely as the athlete moves further from a sound position or as loads increase relative to the athlete\u2019s maximum\nFor example, picking up a grocery bag with a rounded back is a common occurrence and contains little safety risk\nfor many CrossFit athletes. Nevertheless, this same positioning could be more problematic for a beginner deadlifting\n135 lb. or an advanced competitive athlete deadlifting 500 lb.\nIn daily training, athletes are encouraged to exercise using the correct positions to develop strength and awareness\nUsing sound mechanics promotes greater potential for power development and decreases injury risk in the long\nterm. Training in the best positions, regardless of the load present, develops a sound default motor pattern that\nbetter prepares athletes for loaded and high-intensity scenarios.\nBecause of the benefits to safety, efficacy, and efficiency, proper mechanics are a daily focus of CrossFit trainers\nWorking toward better movement is not only for beginners and is arguably more important as the athlete advances\nThe margin for error decreases as load and speed increase. Top competitors rely on efficiencies that can create\nseconds of gain. A trainer cannot settle for anything less than excellent mechanics. For example, an immature squat\nmay be a safe position, but if the athlete can learn to lift the chest, every degree of elevation can increase the loads\nthat can be lifted in a clean or snatch, for example. A trainer must challenge himself or herself to develop better\nathletes beyond their current capacity."}
{"256": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nConCLusion\nThese themes provide a template from which a trainer can evaluate all movement in order to maximize both safety\nand performance for his or her athletes. The ability to recognize and correct violations is essential for a trainer\nregardless of whether the athlete\u2019s violation is major or minor.\nUnderstanding these themes provides a template for evaluating other approaches to coaching a movement. These\nthemes also can help a coach think critically about any methods before including them in instruction: If there is not\na clearly demonstrable mechanism that creates a safer or more effective movement, it is usually an unnecessary\ndistraction.\nFor example, suppose a coach considers a new starting posture for the snatch or clean. He or she wants to use a\ndynamic start such that the athlete moves through the setup without a pause before the first pull. If the athlete\nis able to achieve the common themes (e.g., midline stabilization, posterior-chain engagement, balance about the\nfrontal plane) in a static start and there is no clear performance gain from a dynamic start (i.e., increased loads lifted)\nit becomes an unnecessary layer of complexity to add to the mechanics of the lift. Changes in movement mechanics\nshould be made when there are obvious gains in performance or a decreased risk for injury."}

{"259": "Heavy Days, continued\nHEAVY DAYS\nThere is the tendency for new CrossFit athletes and trainers to avoid heavy days entirely or execute them incorrectly.\nHowever, CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program. While people sometimes characterize CrossFit by its pro-\ngramming of mixed-modal workouts for time (\u201cmet-cons\u201d), this is a limited view. Days devoted to strength training\nare essential to CrossFit and are integral to CrossFit\u2019s prescription of constantly varied workouts.\nHeavy days are necessary to build top-end strength and power. Power output decreases with time, meaning that an\nathlete\u2019s work capacity in very short time domains sets the theoretical limit for his or her entire curve (Figure 1). It is\npossible to have high levels of short-duration power and little power elsewhere (e.g., a powerlifter), but it is impossi-\nble to have low levels of short-duration power and higher levels of longer-duration power. Therefore, heavy days are\nessential to a general physical preparedness program and should be used at least once a week or once every two\ncycles (where a cycle is three on, one off).\nfigure 1. Generalized work-capacity curve.\nHeavy days are not the only time athletes drive strength adaptations. Even within a metabolic-conditioning workout,\ndepending on the task and the capacity of the athlete, any number of exercises may build strength. Push-ups for\nnovices build pressing strength similar to a bench press, and attempting a 95-lb. thruster for a new CrossFit athlete\nbuilds squatting strength. As an athlete\u2019s strength increases, push-ups and 95-lb. thrusters tend to favor other adap-\ntations such as stamina, and greater loads are necessary to further increase top-end power.\nHeavy days can be completed with most any weightlifting or gymnastics movement, such as weighted dips and\npull-ups and lifting odd objects (e.g., sandbags, axles). More often than not, however, a barbell is best because it is\nimpossible to match the barbell\u2019s ease and range of loading with other equipment. Heavy days may also include all\nvariations of standard barbell movements (e.g., hang, power, from a deficit, pulling from pins/bumpers)."}
{"260": "Heavy Days, continued\nRepetition schemes\nThe heavy-day workout consists of small sets, most often in the range of 1 to 5 repetitions, where the total volume of\nworking repetitions is approximately 7 to 25. Repetitions significantly outside this range do not produce the desired\nresponse. If there are too few repetitions (e.g., one repetition of a near-maximum load), the athlete does not produce\nenough stress on the taxed muscles to drive a new adaptation. Conversely, too many repetitions (e.g., 30 or more\nrepetitions of near-maximum load) produces too much stress for the athlete to recover from in a reasonable time\nperiod. The working sets generally occur at or above 80\u201385 percent of a 1-repetition-maximum load, and warm-up\nsets used to get to this loading do not count toward the total working repetitions. This is not an exact percentage\nbut a working set should be heavy enough to require concentrated effort. The working sets also do not produce a\nsignificant cardiorespiratory response.\nRepetition schemes may vary. As a general guideline, the higher the repetitions in a set or across the entire session\nthe lower the loading. This tends to better develop muscular stamina and/or technique. The lower the repetitions\nthe higher the loading. This tends to better develop top-end strength. Both approaches should be used. Repetition\npatterns include standard schemes such as 7 x 1, 5 x 3, 5 x 5 (sets x reps); pyramid-like patterns of 1-2-3-2-1 (reps\nper set); descending/ascending schemes such as 5-4-3-2-1 (reps per set); no set specificity (e.g., work up to a max\npush press); and on-the-minute training (1, 2, or 3 repetitions on the minute, every minute for 10 minutes), among\nothers. Failed attempts count toward working sets. However, the goal of a session should be to complete the majority\nof the lifts.\nHeavy days are for everyone: the young, old, fit, and unfit. Using the concept of relative intensity, a trainer has each\nathlete lift a load that is relatively heavy for him or her. Even beginners should participate, although a trainer should\nbe more cautious progressing a new athlete in load. Trainers can potentially give beginners more repetitions (either\nwithin each set or by increasing the total number of sets) to very gradually progress to a reasonably challenging\nworking weight while instilling appropriate mechanics. Relatively new athletes often set a personal record every time\nthey lift heavy. As the lifter becomes more experienced, sessions without a new personal record may occur. Setting\na personal record is not necessary to reap the benefits of lifting heavy.\nMinimizing risk\nAs risk increases with load, the trainer has several safety concerns to manage when leading a strength session. A\nheavy-day class best begins with a thorough warm-up to prepare the athletes for maximal loading (e.g., increase\ncore temperature and improve range of motion). It also provides the trainer with an opportunity to correct and\nrefine mechanics across warm-up sets of the movement to minimize risk. Finding the best way to complete warm-up\nsets usually becomes an intuitive process as athletes become more experienced with lifting heavy. However, most\nathletes in their first few years still need direction through this section. Common practice for warm-up sets is at\nleast 3 to 5 warm-up sets, where the sets start with a lighter weight/higher repetition count and progress to heavier\nweight/lower repetition count. The rest periods in the warm-up sets do not need to be as long as during the working\nsets. Whatever the warm-up is, trainers cannot fatigue the athlete for the work sets. Instead, warm-up sets gradually\nprime the body for heavier loading while refining the mechanics of the lift.\nThe trainer must also teach each athlete how to bail and/or spot as necessary before any significant weight is\nattempted. It is easiest to have participants practice this with a PVC or dowel. A trainer cannot assume athletes\nwill perform bailing or spotting techniques correctly without specific instructions. The gym floor also needs to be"}
{"261": "Heavy Days, continued\narranged to ensure safe, walkable distance between working athletes, and the floor should be absent of extra equip-\nment. Trainers may choose to have participants share racks, in part to reduce equipment and space needs. Sharing\nracks also allows athletes to help one another with loading, unloading, and spotting. It also allows for adequate\nrest time between sets so athletes fully recover. When using racks, additional instructions are needed to ensure\nthat athletes keep enough distance between themselves and the racks when lifting. The trainer needs to clearly\ndescribe how the working sets should be approached to avoid confusion. For example, the workout may be 5 x 5\nfront squats. Does the trainer want the athletes to try to increase the load with every set? Does the trainer want the\nathletes to hold a certain percentage across all sets? Or does the trainer perhaps want the athletes to find a new\n5-repetition maximum, meaning the exact number of working sets is less important (maybe it takes 4 sets, maybe\n5 sets)? All these approaches have validity and potential benefits, but the trainer needs to indicate what the intent is\non a particular day.\nDuring the working sets, the trainer must appropriately apply the principles of threshold training just as he or she\nwould in any other workout. Once an athlete\u2019s mechanics significantly deviate from the points of performance, the\nload needs to be reduced. This is especially true when multiple verbal and visual cues do not result in any improve-\nment in mechanics. It is possible that the trainer can fix the mechanics at lighter loads and then allow the athlete to\nagain increase the load gradually. Deviations from points of performance may also require the trainer to change the\nmovement for a few repetitions before using the entire movement (e.g., using snatch pulls to correct an athlete who\nis pulling early in the full snatch). Once the workout is complete, the trainer should include equipment clean-up and\nworkout logging as part of the cool-down period.\nCueing during a heavy lifting session needs to be very direct. The athlete\u2019s attention will be almost solely focused\non the effort required to complete the lift. The trainer will have little time or opportunity to impact the quality of the\nmovement during the set. Therefore, cues need to be short, easy to implement, and delivered with an intensity that\nmatches the effort of the lift. If more technical consideration is needed, the time between sets can be a great oppor-\ntunity to elaborate. However, upon returning to the next set, the athlete should have a very clear picture of what he or\nshe needs to focus on. Giving your athlete more than one or two things to think about often results in no change at all\nConCLusion\nTrainers need to regularly program strength days with their clients and ensure all participants achieve the desired\nstimulus during the training session. These sessions provide coaches and athletes with opportunities to improve\nmechanics, acquire new skills, and see progress in a modality that is vital to developing the fitness CrossFit seeks."}

During the Level 1\nnutrition lecture, participants were walked through the importance of eating quality foods, and there was discussion\nof a few common ways to quantify food intake. Eating meats, vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and\nno sugar in combination with weighing and measuring macronutrient quantities can have a profound effect on one\u2019s\nhealth and performance outcomes.\nA tsunami of chronic disease has been sweeping across the world, and CrossFit affiliates are the lifeboats. Each gym\nhas within its walls the necessary ingredients to make profound changes to one\u2019s health.\nAs a coach, knowing what to eat, how to eat, and why it is important is only half the battle. The real struggle is in\nimplementing dietary changes and trying to create a high level of compliance.\nPerhaps one of the most important aspects of behavior change is one\u2019s belief that he or she is capable of making a\nspecific change. This is considered one\u2019s self-efficacy.\nIt is very important for coaches to know they have everything they need in the gym to increase an athlete\u2019s self-effi-\ncacy. Coaches should feel equipped to set up the perfect intervention to get athletes eating better for long periods\nof time, if not indefinitely.\nIt is up to the coach to help increase athletes\u2019 self-efficacy and encourage them to believe that changes are possible.\nIncreases in self-efficacy are a result of:\n\u2022 Mastery experiences: These are small achievable steps throughout the process. Success in these steps will\nincrease self-belief (i.e., adding vegetables to each meal).\n\u2022 A coach\u2019s ability to adjust to different emotional and physiological states: A coach must adjust to how others\nperceive change and deal with stress (i.e., be sensitive to the fact that Rebecca has always eaten this way,\nand she has three young children to consider).\n\u2022 Vicarious experiences: Coaches should use the successes of others to convince athletes that they, too, can\nbe successful (i.e., Joe started by cutting out low-quality food for a month. Then he would quantify only his\nbreakfast. Eventually, he measured his lunch, and six months later, he has lost 40 lb.).\n\u2022 Verbal/social persuasion: Athletes should receive verbal support from others, including from role models\n(the trainer) and/or in small groups (i.e., create an accountability buddy, send reminders, videos, articles\ncontaining any material that motivates the individual to stay the course).\nThese are four factors that affect self-efficacy (Bandura). These factors should be sought in combination with each\nother for best results.\nWhen thinking about behavior change within the context of a gym environment, we can understand the stages of\nchange as contemplation, action, and maintenance. These three stages apply most accurately to the gym environ-\nment and the relationship between coach and athlete."}
{"268": "Nutrition, continued\nContemplation: The athlete has a desire to make a change and recognizes that his or her behavior may be problematic\nAction: The behavior change has been initiated and healthier behaviors are being acquired.\nMaintenance: There is sustained healthy behavior and the athlete has developed the skills to deal with relapse.\nA key component to successfully changing behavior and progressing through each stage is self-efficacy. Does the\nathlete believe in his or her ability to change eating habits and to eat the optimal ratios and amounts?\nConTeMPLaTion\nA coach must first educate. Teaching the art of nutrition is no different than teaching functional movements. It stil\nrequires an in-depth knowledge of the material:\n\u2022 What are quality foods? What are unhealthy foods? How do you replace the unhealthy foods with healthier\nchoices?\n\u2022 How do you quantify macronutrients, and what tools are needed to weigh and measure?\n\u2022 Why is changing your diet important, and what are the expected outcomes?\n\u2022 What skills do you need to make this change and maintain it?\nCoaches then need to find the best way to communicate this information to their athletes. The explanation must be\nsimple, actionable, and realistic. This starts the process of building the skill set and producing the incentives required\nto make meaningful changes to diet.\nSuccessful gyms have accomplished this in a number of ways.\n\u2022 Small Nutrition Talks\n{ These talks are often provided during introductory sessions.\n{ Each small talk builds on the one prior. Athletes continue to develop knowledge and enhance skills\nin small steps (mastery experiences).\n{ Typically, food logs are used to determine necessary changes.

The assumption\nthat building a shopping list is easy is one of the reasons many do not succeed. The coach\nmust guide this process.\n\u2022 Large Nutrition Lectures\n{ Typically, these are lectures that cover everything from eating quality foods to using different ways\nto weigh and measure food.\n{ The information is provided all at once to a large group of athletes, typically with a question and\nanswer session at the end.\n{ These tend to be used as an introduction to nutrition challenges.\n\u0083 The main points might be covered again in a small group format during the challenge.\nIt is important to understand that how someone perceives the journey will also have a profound impact on the results\nPerception is reality.

It is easy to\ncomplete a nutrition challenge and then fall back into old habits, eating the same way as before.\nVicarious experiences\nOne way a trainer can keep this behavior going is to provide vicarious experiences.\n\u2022 Find members that have had long-term success and use their stories.

{"274": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nPROGRAM DESIGN AND SCALING\nCrossFit is defined as \u201cconstantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity,\u201d with the goal to develop\nfitness that prepares one optimally for any task imaginable. The programming material of the Level 1 Course outlines\nworkout variables and basic considerations for structuring workouts. The programming material at this course builds\non that foundation by focusing on long-term program design for individuals and groups.\nAmong the myriad variables to control when programming workouts, a trainer cannot lose sight of the small influ-\nence programming has among a host of other factors that determine a client\u2019s success. Programming, whether\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d is secondary to effective coaching, appropriate scaling, using sound mechanics, and developing a\ngroup dynamic conducive to pushing oneself (i.e., highest intensity brought to the work). Even with less-than-optimal\nprogramming, a trainer who has a good eye for movement mechanics and develops a good rapport with his or her\nclients will help people improve their fitness for years. Functional movements performed at high intensity, regard-\nless of how well they are combined and varied, are powerful enough to elicit dramatic changes in one\u2019s health and\nperformance, particularly for the unaccustomed. Therefore, trainers can spend more time focusing on their skill set\nand member rapport rather than striving beyond reason to create the \u201cperfect\u201d template and programming cycles.\nANALYZING PROGRAMMING FOR EFFECTIVENESS\nEffective or \u201cgood\u201d programming produces results, and the relative degree to which programming is effective is the\ndegree to which it optimizes fitness. The standard by which to evaluate any programming is measurable improve-\nment in performance markers. For a CrossFit athlete, results would include increased loads on heavy days, decreased\ntimes on task-priority workouts, and increased repetitions or rounds on time-priority workouts. An optimal program\nwould see the maximum possible increases in any test of fitness.\nOther measurable markers include health markers. Faster Fran times, more rounds of Cindy, and heavier 1-repe-\ntition-maximum clean and jerks are correlated with decreases in blood pressure, triglycerides, and resting heart\nrate. Additional results may be reported by clients, such as improved quality of life, improved confidence, increased\nenergy, and mood alteration. Anecdotal improvements in quality of life are side benefits of CrossFit. While not mea-\nsurable, they are valued by many clients over the metrics of improved workout statistics and health markers.\nIneffective programming does not produce results, or at least not to the same degree possible with effective pro-\ngramming. These suboptimal results could include decreased performance on benchmark workouts, merely modest\nimprovements in performance markers, or even a higher rate of injury, which could be easily avoided by following\nother programming.\nThe key is that program effectiveness is based on results: real changes in measurable, observable, repeatable\nmarkers. Clients need to get results for the programming to be deemed effective.\nTrainers programming for a group or an entire affiliate can simply use the same measurement applied across the\nentire gym population. A trainer can look for long-term trends and patterns in the group by assessing performance\non select benchmarks. For example, a trainer may select specific benchmarks to follow: He or she may track clients\n1-repetition-maximum snatch, 1-repetition-maximum back squat, Grace, Fran, Tabata squats, 1-mile run, JT, Fight\nGone Bad, 5-km row, and Cindy as his or her fitness tests. An evaluation does not have to include these exact"}

As long as\nthe majority of members are improving their scores on these days, the programming is effective. A trainer must\nremember that this is a long-term view, and he or she cannot expect everyone to set a personal record (PR) with every\nbenchmark test due to variables beyond his or her control, such as mood, sleep, stress, the physiology of the athlete\nand even the athlete\u2019s commitment to the program. Intermediate to advanced athletes, for example, cannot expect\nto set personal records every time they repeat a workout due to the decreased magnitude of adaptations that result\nfrom increased proficiency (i.e., the learning curve).\nvarianCe in CrossfiT PrograMMing\n\u201cVariance\u201d refers to the intended variation of functional movements, loads, repetition schemes, and time durations\nwithin a single workout and across a series of workouts in order to best maximize one\u2019s fitness. Other factors (e.g.\nenvironment, gear) can be varied but are not the primary variables to consider. The variation of workout variables\nacross months and years determines how well one is prepared for any conceivable test of fitness. A program with\na narrow focus may show great results in one area but have little impact on another. For example, a powerlifting\nprogram may see increases in strength and power for certain lifts, but it might produce worse performance in lon-\nger-duration, higher-repetition scenarios or even decreased strength and power in certain other lifts, like the snatch\nIn the name of variance, there are few absolutes for formulating the infinite combinations of workout variables. An\nerror in programming variance is only problematic when the error becomes routine. Today\u2019s workout does not have a\ndramatic impact on one\u2019s fitness; it is the series of workouts that result in long-term change. Programming too many\nheavy days in a row, for example, develops a narrow capacity. Conversely, programming a few heavy days back-to-\nback on occasion may be an entirely appropriate or beneficial stimulus.\nLong-term planning and routine assessment\nEffectively combining workout variables over the long term requires intentional and careful planning. The program-\nmer must be well versed in CrossFit methodology to understand similar and disparate stimuli, as well as which\nstimuli are the most potent. Programming requires reviewing what has been completed recently in an attempt to\nprovide new variance. It must also allow for routine assessment to ensure progress is occurring.\nTo a lesser degree, the programmer must understand each athlete\u2019s current capacity and weaknesses. For any\nlevel of athlete, a well-varied program should cover many different aspects of fitness. As an athlete becomes more\nadvanced (e.g., a CrossFit Games competitor), additional time may be needed to improve weaknesses in addition to\nregular CrossFit programming. Regardless, effective programming cannot be random. Although CrossFit program-\nming appears random to some due to its non-linear and non-formulaic pattern, its variety is a result of a planned\nattempt to address all fitness tests. This does not happen by the luck of the draw.\nCrossFit.com programming\nCrossFit.com provides a great expression of variance for general physical preparedness. An athlete who can perform\nall main-site workouts as prescribed (Rx\u2019d) has a robust fitness capacity. Across all the workouts on CrossFit.com\nsome very broad trends suggest some combinations are more useful than others to develop this level of fitness\nCrossFit more frequently programs whole-body, natural, high-power movements in short, intense workouts because\nof their far-reaching effects on one\u2019s overall fitness. These principles are generally expressed in task-priority couplets\nand triplets of 15 minutes or less, which include full-body, high-power movements utilizing complementary functions\n(e.g., pulling vs. pressing).

{"276": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nprogrammer cannot be fooled into believing the simplicity of the movements and combinations equates to \u201csimple\u201d\nresults. Complexity does not inherently produce greater efficiency or efficacy, and arguably it detracts from both.\nClassic CrossFit benchmark workouts such as Fran, Helen, Diane, Elizabeth, and Fight Gone Bad are all excellent\nexamples of these basic principles. Fran (21-15-9 repetitions of thrusters and pull-ups) is an elegant combination\ntwo full-body movements, complementary in function (lower-body push and upper-body pull) to allow intensity to\nremain high while simultaneously expressing functions necessitated by life (squatting, putting an object overhead\npulling the body up).\nCrossFit programming is best summarized in World-Class Fitness in 100 Words, by CrossFit Founder Coach Greg\nGlassman: \u201cPractice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C & J (clean and jerk), and snatch. Similarly\nmaster the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips\nsplits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc., hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many\ncombinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly\nlearn and play new sports.\u201d\nAlthough many CrossFit workouts follow these trends, not all should. Less frequently, athletes need to be exposed to\nworkouts that are more unorthodox. For example, there are times when workout variables that result in decreased\npower output are entirely beneficial for an individual. A load that may be too heavy for an athlete to move con-\ntinuously in a workout is also a stimulus for greater strength. A high-repetition scheme that causes the athlete to\nstop multiple times in a single set is a stimulus for greater stamina. Even using lower-powered movements such\nas a Turkish get-up in a workout are useful occasionally for developing greater coordination, balance, and shoulder\nstrength under cardiorespiratory stress. The bulk of workouts, however, should strive for simple, bold pairings.\noPTiMiZing CrossfiT PrograMMing\nMost every client can improve his or her fitness without individualized programming. Small adjustments in the\ncontext of regular CrossFit programming, such as weakness work and scaling workouts appropriately, can accelerate\na client\u2019s results within general group programming.\nWorking weaknesses\nA weakness is a certain skill that is lacking relative to an athlete\u2019s proficiency in other areas. By improving one\u2019s\ncapacity in these weak areas, the athlete\u2019s overall fitness increases. Effective CrossFit programming by itself is aimed\ntoward improving weaknesses. With well-varied, unbiased combinations of loads, time durations, movements\netc., clients inevitably see improvements in their fitness for years. Over the months and years, just performing the\nelements one struggles with will improve one\u2019s proficiency in these movements.\nAn athlete may choose to do additional weakness work to accelerate progress and will likely find this also improves\nstrengths. Working on weaknesses is also important for clients who have reached a plateau. Coach Glassman has\nasserted the following: \u201cThere is more traction, more advantage, more opportunity in pursuing that one thing that\nyou don\u2019t want to see come out (of the hopper) headlong than to put more time into that thing you\u2019re already good\nat. That thing that you don\u2019t want to see come out is a chink in your armor. And addressing it will make a difference\nfor you in ways that you\u2019ll never be able to predict.\u201d"}
{"277": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nIt is unlikely that the programming needs to change drastically to address weaknesses, particularly for an affiliate\nor large group setting. Further, trying to tailor the program to every individual weakness is impossible. The best the\ntrainer can do is to observe and respond to the general trends in the gym and provide well-varied programming\nconsistently.\nConstant assessment is needed to ensure that too much capacity is not lost in the strong areas. When assessment\nhas shown that the weak areas are now at an acceptable level, the trainer should look to identify the next area\nof weakness and make small adjustments accordingly. A radical change in programming is likely to eliminate the\nbenefits experienced elsewhere (e.g., programming becomes too skewed toward the new goal).\nIf the programming becomes too skewed toward working on specific elements, then it is biased. Biasing is program-\nming certain elements more frequently regardless of current capacity in those areas. Biasing does not necessarily\nresult in an increase in fitness; it results in an increase in a specific capacity. Biasing is not necessarily negative if it\nserves the athlete\u2019s preference or goal. It is only a problem when the athlete is seeking general fitness and continues\nto follow a biased program. Addressing weaknesses may eventually become a bias in the absence of assessment.\nWeakness work can be easily included in the warm-up of the class, focusing on the technique of one of the more chal-\nlenging movements. This gives clients extra practice time to improve a deficiency and potentially allows for a more\n\u201cpersonalized\u201d program. During warm-up and skill sessions, which are often heavily biased toward newer and less\nproficient athletes, an effective trainer needs to also offer challenging options for the advanced athletes.\nFor example, suppose a trainer led a warm-up that included a skill session on pistols. Although most of the athletes\nmay be working on getting their first pistol, perhaps using a band or squatting to a box with a support, advanced\nathletes may be working on weighted pistols (e.g., with a bar in the overhead-squat position). There are examples of\nhow to use warm-ups to implement weakness work in the \u201cExample Warm-ups to Address Weaknesses\u201d section of\nthis training guide. With well-varied workouts, much of the warm-up can coincide with movement preparation for the\nworkout to practice elements that are usually weak (e.g., handstand push-ups, muscle-ups, double-unders).\nRegardless of the movements selected, trainers should be sure to avoid pre-fatiguing the client. The goal of the\nwarm-up is not to make it another workout. An example of a poor choice of warm-up may be doing three rounds of\n15 pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, and hip extensions before the workout Cindy (as many repetitions as possible\nin 20 minutes of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats). Pre-fatigue is of particular concern when a trainer plans\na longer skill session before the workout, such as handstand push-up skill work before the workout Diane (21-15-9\nrepetitions of deadlifts and handstand push-ups). Such skill work can be done, but the trainer must monitor the\nvolume such that the athletes are not unduly fatigued. Each athlete has variable tolerance to pre-workout volume\nrelative to that athlete\u2019s capacity. The tolerance builds over time, so the warm-up can eventually be more extensive\nwithout pre-fatiguing muscles.\nTemplates can be used for weakness work. They can help keep a coach or athlete committed to dedicating time to\nskill development. However, it is important for coaches and athletes to use their judgment to change or break from\nthe template as necessary.\nScaling effectively\nScaling workouts appropriately for one\u2019s clients is an essential consideration to best increase their fitness. This is not"}
{"278": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\njust a concept for beginner clients; an effective trainer progresses the most athletes toward completing workouts as\nprescribed across months and years.\nTo scale effectively, a trainer needs to review the original workout for its intended stimulus, including:\n\u2022 movement functions,\n\u2022 loading parameters,\n\u2022 time frame, and\n\u2022 volume of repetitions.\nThis does not have to be a formal process, but it helps identify appropriate scaling options.\nSuppose an affiliate decided to post the workout Amanda (9-7-5 repetitions of muscle-ups and 135-lb. snatches) for\nits daily classes. This is a workout most members at most affiliates have to scale. The basic analysis of the workout\nvariables shows:\n1. a high-skill gymnastics movement that is an upper-body pull and push and a high-skill weightlifting\nmovement that is predominantly a lower-body pull and squat,\n2. the intended loading is moderate,\n3. the intended time is short (approximately 5 minutes), and\n4. the volume is low.\nThe goal for scaling this workout is to adhere to as many of these variables as possible in light of the individual\u2019s\ncapacity. The resulting scaled workout still needs to provide each client with a significant challenge. There is no single\nstrategy that works in every situation. Scaling is also a \u201cmoving target\u201d as individual capacities change over time.\nThere are some populations for which a trainer can employ common scaling strategies:\n1. beginners and/or deconditioned individuals,\n2. intermediate athletes,\n3. advanced athletes, and\n4. injured athletes.\nScaling guidelines, and examples for the workout Amanda, are detailed below.\nBeginners and/or deconditioned individuals are generally those athletes who have been doing CrossFit for six months\nor less. For beginner and/or deconditioned individuals, a trainer needs to be primarily concerned with adherence to\nthe proper points of performance of the movements throughout the full range of motion. Increasing the difficulty\n(via movements or volume) and/or pushing for greater intensity (via speed or load) are secondary to developing\nmovement proficiency and new skill development. This group may often include the elderly, where additional safety\nconcerns may be necessary (e.g., keeping feet on the floor). Beginners need a lot of guidance: The trainer must be\nproactive about approaching them and modifying the workout.\nLoads, distances, and repetitions are the primary variables to modify during scaling, particularly before changing the\nmovement. If a movement is beyond the athlete\u2019s current abilities, a substitution should create a similar movement\nfunction and range of motion. In some cases, preserving function and range of motion can be done by using severa\nmovements to achieve a similar effect. Also, it is not \u201cstandard\u201d to increase the volume of the substituted or \u201cless"}
{"279": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nchallenging\u201d movement. For example, it is not necessary to always make those substituting single-unders for dou-\nble-unders complete two or three times the repetitions. This group often needs reduced volume, even with a substi-\ntuted movement.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for beginners/deconditioned individuals include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Reduce to whatever allows the athlete to best practice the movement with full range\nof motion. This may be a training bar, empty barbell, or even PVC pipe. If the athlete has to go very light\nto preserve movement mechanics, consider doubling the repetition scheme. This gives the athlete more\npractice repetitions, which is the primary concern for the inexperienced. It is also possible to reduce the\nrange of motion in a loaded scenario if the mechanics cannot otherwise be preserved. Regardless of the\nscaling choice, the workout should provide some challenge across the repetitions.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. Replace with a simple upper-body pull and push. Most likely, this will be jumping\npull-ups or ring rows, and squat-assisted dips, bench dips, or push-ups. These options are mechanically\nsimple relative to the muscle-up, so a trainer needs to pick an option that provides a challenge to the\nathlete\u2019s upper-body strength across the total repetitions.\nAlthough not an exact guideline, the term \u201cintermediate athletes\u201d generally describes those who have been doing\nCrossFit for six months to three years. An intermediate athlete is one who can perform some workouts as prescribed\nbut still struggles with more complex movements or challenging repetition schemes and loads. Scaling the repeti-\ntions on some gymnastics movements and the loads on some weightlifting movements is the main priority. A trainer\nmust be mindful that an intermediate athlete is best served by using different scaling options each time a particular\nmovement or load appears in a workout. A trainer can create several different options for intermediate athletes\nnot only to avoid boredom, but also to help them continue to develop their fitness. Varying the manner in which a\nworkout is scaled reduces the timeframe needed to acquire the desired adaptation.\nWith time, intermediate athletes should be able to adequately scale their own workouts. This comes with a better\nunderstanding of workout goals and their own strengths and weaknesses. Intermediate athletes may be incor-\nrectly neglected at times because they require less guidance than the beginner. Nevertheless, the majority of one\u2019s\nmembers will likely be intermediate athletes with a wide range of abilities. These athletes still need to be pushed to\nnew levels as appropriate.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for intermediate athletes include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Intermediate athletes often include individuals who should stay at the prescribed\nweight and potentially take longer to complete the workout. Although their power output may be lower\nthan if the load was scaled, keeping the load as prescribed helps develop exactly the strength and\nstamina needed to perform the workout in a more competitive time. In cases where this load would\nnot be completed in any realistic time frame (i.e., would take more than 20 minutes), reduce the load\nappropriately.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. The scale is best when it is specific to the weakness, and it therefore does not take\non one specific form. If they have significant upper-body capacity in pull-ups and dips, an effective scale\nwould be to work a transition drill, as that is where their capacity is lacking (i.e., working the transition\nhelps strengthen a greater range of motion at the shoulder).

Depending on proficiency, perhaps the\nrepetitions of pull-ups and dips should be increased. If there is an athlete who has muscle-ups but is not\nconsistent with them or cannot perform a high volume, reducing the repetitions is a viable option to help\ntrain the skill in a mixed-modal environment (e.g., repetitions of 5-4-3).\nAdvanced-level athletes are those who can perform all workouts and movements as prescribed. Typically, these\nathletes either came to CrossFit after years of performing some functional movements at high intensities (e.g., col-\nlegiate gymnast) or they have been doing CrossFit consistently for years. There are times a trainer needs to scale\nthis athlete due to sickness, injury, personal problems, or a recent string of difficult/demanding workouts. Occasion-\nally suggesting a variation with lower loading and/or repetitions benefits the advanced athlete both physically and/\nor mentally.\nThere may be an occasion to \u201cscale up\u201d an individual if the athlete is not challenged by the repetition scheme or weight\nor is in need of a different stimulus for skill development. The obvious options are to increase load or repetitions\nchoose different equipment (dumbbells vs. barbells), or make a movement more difficult (parallette vs. regular hand-\nstand push-ups). A trainer needs to be wary of this practice and should avoid consistently making workouts heavier\nand higher in volume to provide a \u201cchallenge.\u201d More often than not, the advanced athlete needs to be coached to\nbetter movement mechanics and/or greater intensity before making a workout \u201charder.\u201d An effective trainer needs to\nfocus on fixing movement inefficiencies and pushing for faster speeds before increasing the weights and repetitions\nThese corrections translate to seconds of gain in performance.\nCoaches need to be sure not to confuse advanced for elite, where elite is reserved for individuals actually going to the\nGames. Competitive programming is outside the scope of this course, as well as outside the scope of most affiliate\nneeds. At a minimum, athletes should be considered advanced before more volume is needed.\nSome potential scaling options for an advanced athlete in Amanda are listed below. There are infinite ways to tweak\nthe workout based on needs and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the athlete. These would be good options\nparticularly when an advanced athlete already has a competitive Amanda time.\n\u2022 Snatch.

These individuals should be encouraged to par-\nticipate in the workout, as there is benefit to training even in their reduced capacity. There is a positive hormona\nresponse from exercise, which can affect a multitude of factors, from body weight to recovery to mental state\nAlthough the nature of injury determines what is possible, the goal is still the same: to replicate all workout variables\nas closely as possible.\nPain-free range of motion is the main guideline. Where the movement cannot be performed exactly, a trainer should\nfind a substitute that best replicates the basic function and/or range of motion. However, any movement that stil\nrelies primarily on the injured joint/body part should be used cautiously, if at all. A trainer may need to get creative at\ntimes to help athletes avoid boredom and keep an injured athlete working for new skill acquisition."}
{"281": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nSingle-limb work can be utilized: Contrary to the belief that this results in a problematic muscular imbalance, exer-\ncising the non-injured side can reduce atrophy in the injured side. Dumbbells are a perfect tool for one-sided work\nand the number of repetitions can increase in cases where the loading is limited. However, this should not be the\nonly option for someone with an injured limb. If an exercise involves two movement functions, an athlete may stil\nbe able to perform one with both sides. For example, in a thruster, an athlete with an injured upper body might stil\nbe able to squat or front squat. If the athlete has an injured lower body, he or she might still be able to press or push\npress. If there are no reasonable options for an injured person to perform a similar movement, omit the movement\nor substitute something else. This should be the last option considered.\nUsing the workout Amanda as an example, scaling options for injured athletes would take on many different forms\ndepending on the injury. Here are a couple of examples:\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s shoulder is injured such that he or she cannot support any load with one arm.\nPotentially, the snatch becomes a heavy dumbbell snatch on the good side, or it could become a 135-lb.\nback squat; the load could even be increased to be more challenging in the 9-7-5 repetition scheme. The\nmuscle-up may become a single-arm ring row and push-up or dumbbell press.\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s knee is injured such that he or she has limited flexion. The snatch may become a\nsnatch variation (power, muscle, hang) depending on the range of motion of the knee. The muscle-up\nwould not have to be scaled.\nWhen the injured side is cleared to be used again, the trainer must increase intensity very gradually, with a heavy\nemphasis on maintaining optimal mechanics to prevent additional injuries.\nImplementing scaling in a class environment\nAfter a trainer has analyzed the workout and knows what is likely to need scaling (especially movement substitutions)\ndirection must be given to the entire class to help each individual to the appropriate modification. While this can be\ndifficult in a busy class setting, a lot of scaling confusion can be prevented when the trainer introduces the workout\nto the class by indicating the intended stimulus or goal of the workout. Loading, repetition, time, and movement\nconsiderations can be discussed.\nPresenting several scaling options at this time can help keep the class moving. Some gyms present set scaling options\nthat keep large groups organized. This is fine, but a trainer must also recognize that the best choice for some athletes\nmay be an entirely different option. An experienced trainer should have no problem creating unique scaling options\nas necessary without taking away from class instruction and group cohesion.\nThe trainer also needs to observe clients as they increase loads and practice the movements in preparation for the\nworkout. An effective trainer can quickly see if the movement loading and repetition scheme chosen for the workout\nare appropriate by watching warm-up sets. There are times when scaling may have been assessed incorrectly and\na trainer needs to scale after the workout has begun. If an athlete is struggling too early in the workout and will not\nachieve the desired outcome, the trainer needs to adjust one or more of the workout variables mid-workout (e.g.\nload, repetitions). This is mandatory if an athlete cannot maintain safe mechanics. In these instances, it is important\nthat the trainer is firm with his or her decision. If he or she has built a good rapport with athletes, they should have\nno problem with such adjustments."}

The general guideline is to add CrossFit volume\ncautiously while constantly assessing sport performance and being particularly cautious when an athlete is near in\ntime to an important event.\nPrograMMing ConsideraTions: CoMMon PiTfaLLs\nIf a programmer regularly assesses his or her athletes and observes the trends in data, he or she can quickly adjust\nineffective programming. Conversely, CrossFit programmers who do not regularly assess data can fall prey to\ncommon faults, some of which are described below.\n1. The first common error made by CrossFit programmers is a lack of regular assessment to determine\neffectiveness. Measurable results in performance markers are the guideposts for a programmer to\ndetermine whether the past programming was productive as well as what needs to be programmed next\nLack of assessment may occur from not repeating benchmark workouts and/or not recording results\nTrainers need to encourage members to record results to assist with this effort. Clients generally like this\nrecord of progress, particularly after months and years of hard work.\n2. Another error for CrossFit programmers occurs when variance is not applied correctly, and this is usually\nexpressed in one of three ways: randomization of workout variables, biasing certain variables, or emphasizing\nnon-essential elements. As mentioned above, optimal variance of workout variables requires intentiona\nplanning, not merely spinning the hopper and pulling out random tasks. A hopper may be used as a good\ntest of fitness (i.e., is an athlete ready for anything?), but it is not a good method to prepare for everything\nReliance on the hopper would leave to chance the broad, general, and inclusive adaptations CrossFit is"}
{"283": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\ntrying to develop. Programming via a hopper may be fun once in a while and can be used occasionally in\ncompetitions, but it is not a method by which to program for the best results.\nBiasing occurs when certain elements or combinations are repeated too often, with some elements avoided\ncompletely. There is nothing inherently bad about biasing as long as that is the intended goal. Biasing is a prob-\nlem if the goal is to develop general physical preparedness.\nAnother misapplication of variance is emphasizing non-essential elements. This appears as an endless\ncombination of workout variables, regardless of their utility or effect. For example, never repeating work-\nouts, performing lots of accessory or skill movements in actual workouts (e.g., Sots presses, single-leg work\nsport-specific drills), or focusing too much on environmental factors (e.g., working out with a gas mask or in the\nmiddle of the night) can be signs that variance is being misapplied. It can be easy for newer programmers to\nbelieve \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d programming provides a superior stimulus because of the novelty.\n3. A third common error in CrossFit programming is a lack of higher-skill development. This can occur when\ncertain movements are avoided in workouts or when warm-ups are not used to address weaknesses. A\ncurrent trend within the community is to avoid the more difficult gymnastics movements. CrossFit athletes\nare willing to tackle the technical weightlifting movements such as the snatch and clean and jerk but do not\nspend as much time developing the more technical counterparts in gymnastics, such as levers, planches\npresses to handstands, or pirouettes.\n4. CrossFit programmers may be tempted to use excessive volume. This occurs with more than one training\nsession a day (i.e., double days). In some cases, athletes may even attempt more than two sessions. This\npitfall affects those trying to emulate the volume sometimes used by CrossFit Games athletes. Games\nathletes\u2019 training is not representative of what CrossFit programming should look like. Multiple sessions a\nday are not appropriate for 99 percent of CrossFit athletes (less than one percent of those who participate\nin the Open go to the Games). Even multiple workouts in one extended \u201csession\u201d should generally be\navoided. Extra sessions and/or extra workouts may help performance in the short term but often lead to\novertraining, higher risk of injury, and burnout in the long term. Double days help Games athletes prepare\nfor high-volume competition and can help them get in more volume so they can advance certain skills\nrelative to their competitors. Generally, however, there is actually a decrease in intensity across sessions. As\nCoach Glassman said, \u201cBe impressed by intensity, not volume.\u201d If a client is looking to be competitive, very\ngradually and cautiously increase volume. For example, start with additional skill sessions (e.g., double-\nunder practice) in areas in which the athlete is not as proficient, not multiple workouts. Look at CrossFit\ncom and assess what the athlete cannot complete, then add \u201cvolume\u201d by way of working on these skills. The\nvolume should gradually increase over the long term.\n5. Another trickle-down effect from the Games is the assumption that the \u201cCrossFit standard\u201d for a movement\nis what is performed at the CrossFit Games. Standards in competition are set for ease of judging and do\nnot necessarily represent the best expression of the movement. They are used to establish the minimum\nrequirements for a repetition, and an athlete is held to those standards to ensure the range of motion is\nthe same across all competitors. Take, for example, hand-release push-ups: There is nothing better about\nthem in terms of muscular development or mechanical advantage. They are used because they are easier"}
{"284": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nto judge; a judge can easily ensure the chest and thighs make contact with the ground on every single\nrepetition. Standards in competitions should not prevent an athlete from using (or a trainer from teaching)\nmany different movement mechanics to develop a broad athletic capacity. There are different adaptations\nto all movements, and variations at the very least improve the overall coordination of an athlete who can\naccomplish a single task in multiple ways. CrossFit encourages athletes to learn all possible techniques and\nnot a single \u201cstandard\u201d (e.g., strict, chest-to-bar, kipping, and butterfly kipping pull-ups). This is another face\nof variance needed to develop the athletic capacity to accomplish tasks in multiple ways, and it is what wil\nbest prepare one for any test of fitness.\nConCLusion\nEffective programming occurs by applying basic tenets when selecting workout elements and combinations\nOptimizing long-term program design is best guided by observing results (i.e., objective and measurable change\nin performance markers) and applying focused weakness work or appropriate scaling. The elements of the daily\nworkouts are but one factor that affects how well an individual optimizes his or her fitness.

{"291": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nCLASS STRUCTURE AND LESSON PLANNING\nDuring the Level 2 Course, participants are led through a mock class from start to finish. It is meant to serve as a basic\nclass template for CrossFit affiliates. Although each example class at the Level 2 course is different\u2014from instructors\nto warm-up drills to workouts\u2014universally, there are themes that represent effective coaching practices.\nBeing a trainer is not about showing up, quickly writing a last-minute workout at the whiteboard, and turning on the\nmusic. Real training is about improving each client\u2019s fitness (and by association quality of life) in small, incremental\nsteps in a motivating and positive way. Besides having the presence, attitude, and demonstration skills to develop a\npositive rapport with one\u2019s clients (see \u201cFoundations of Effective Training\u201d), a large part of improving client fitness is\nhaving a plan, both on a day-to-day and long-term basis. This section discusses the basic but necessary components\na trainer needs to run a single class.\nTo effectively manage time, trainers need to have a lesson plan. A single class can be outlined as a four-part lesson\nplan consisting of:\n\u2022 Introduction\n\u2022 Warm-Up\n\u2022 Workout\n\u2022 Post-Workout\nThe total time of the workout helps set the allotted time for the warm-up and cool-down sections. A longer workout\nmeans sacrificing time in either or both. Most affiliates run hour-long classes, and this is the length used in the Level\n2 example class.\nLogistical considerations affect an appropriate workout to select, as well as the time allotted to each component of\nthe class. Factors include gear availability, class size, gym space (for equipment and athlete layout), and the expe-\nrience level of the class. A trainer needs to consider various alternatives because additional modifications may be\nnecessary on the fly, depending on the experience level of the clients and how many show up. For example, if the\naffiliate has limited floor space, it will not take many participants to make it cramped. For safety considerations, a\ntrainer needs to ensure there are walkable areas between all moving athletes and their equipment. Dumbbells are\na phenomenal tool for athletes; they are great space savers, as well as substitutes for barbells in many scenarios.\nTrainers may also use sandbags, the outdoors, staggered heats, etc. Trainers are limited only by their knowledge\nand creativity.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction, although the shortest element of a class, is of great importance. During the introduction\n(commonly referred to as the time \u201cat the whiteboard\u201d), the coach will brief the workout, set expectations by explain-\ning the intended stimulus, offer several scaling options, and take any questions. Generally, the introduction will take\nbetween two and four minutes, depending on the complexity of the workout and the number of participants taking\nclass. Having more participants increases the likelihood of questions. The introduction should serve to clear up any\nconfusion about the workout while also reducing pre-workout anxiety."}
{"292": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nWarm-up\nThe purpose of the warm-up is to do just that: warm the body in preparation for intense activity. Warm-ups often\nconsist of two parts: a general warm-up and a specific warm-up. The main goal of a general warm-up is to stimulate\nthe body\u2019s physiological functions\u2014i.e., increase core temperature and blood flow to the muscles, prime the car-\ndiorespiratory system, increase mobility, and move joints through a full range of motion. General warm-ups usually\ninclude calisthenic-type movements or movements that involve dynamic ranges of motion.\nThe primary goals of a specific warm-up are to build, practice, and refine proper mechanics for the movements that\nwill be used in the workout, and to prepare mentally and physically for the challenge. Specific warm-ups present an\nopportunity for movement assessment and appropriate scaling. However, potentially different ranges of motion\nand/or variations may be used (e.g., power vs. squat variations, medicine balls vs. barbells) where necessary.\nMovements that are not part of the workout may also be used in the warm-up, as the warm-up element also provides\nan opportunity to improve deficiencies in any movements (i.e., practicing handstands even though handstands may\nnot be in the workout). Typically, these options are reserved for shorter, lower-skill workouts that do not require a\nsignificant amount of time to prepare for (i.e., rowing 1,000 meters for time or running a timed mile). The \u201cProgram\nDesign and Scaling\u201d article discusses how to use this time as focused weakness work.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and coach in the warm-up period. The warm-up helps athletes best prepare\nto handle the demands of the workout and improve upon deficiencies, whether they are subtle mechanical ineffi-\nciencies in more experienced athletes or larger faults in movements with which athletes have little experience. The\nwarm-up also provides the trainer with an opportunity to assess the athletic capacity of an individual relative to\nthe intended stimulus. Following the assessment/practice period, it is time for the trainer to assign scaling options\nAlthough the trainer should have some ideas before starting a class, it isn\u2019t until after actually assessing athletes\nneeds that a trainer can choose the most effective option(s). As discussed in the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article\nscaling should progress with the athletes, and they should be constantly challenged (i.e., they should not just perform\nthe same scale every time a movement, rep range, or prescribed load is outside their current capacity). Beyond\nassessment and scaling, the warm-up is also the time for the coach to mentally prepare the athletes and oversee any\nremaining workout logistics (e.g., equipment distribution, equipment layout, heats, safety checks).\nA pre-workout break is not one of the main elements of a lesson plan, but it is needed and useful for a coach. The\npre-workout break includes safety and equipment checks, room layout, workout flow, additional scaling, questions\nfrom the athletes, a bathroom opportunity, and of course, the workout re-brief.\nThe workout re-brief is there to remind the athletes what the workout is (order of movements, repetition scheme\nand rounds or time) and the range-of-motion standards that are required. A coach needs to clearly demonstrate and\nemphasize the range of motion and mechanics for every movement before every single workout. This makes it easier\nto hold athletes to these standards during the workout and cultivate a culture of virtuosity in one\u2019s gym.\nWe must remember, especially for newer athletes, workout abbreviations and acronyms on the whiteboard are not\nself-evident. A coach may choose to discuss scaling options with the entire class at this time or even review the\nintended stimulus of the workout. This could potentially include describing the targeted time domain, loading, or skil\nacquisition. For example, the workout Elizabeth (21-15-9 repetitions of cleans at 135 lb. and ring dips) is a relatively\nshort workout (about 5 min.), with moderate loading. Novice CrossFit athletes likely have to reduce the load for the"}
{"293": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nclean to their level of moderate loading (e.g., 95 lb.), and they might have to address the dips\u2019 load (e.g., band, bench)\nor volume (e.g., 12-9-6) to best match the original workout intent. See the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article for\nmore information about preserving the intended stimulus.\nWhether in the pre-workout brief or the specific warm-up, time should be allotted for athletes to practice the exact\nstandards to be used in the workout. If the movement is loaded, additional time is needed for athletes to work up to\nan appropriate load under the discretion of the trainer.\nWorkout\nOnce the workout begins, the demands on a coach\u2019s abilities increase. Coaching is not about repetition counting\ncheering, or selecting music. It is about appropriately applying threshold training, which means pushing an athlete\u2019s\nintensity while maintaining sound mechanics. This balance is what helps minimize the risk for injury but also keeps\nthe intensity high to drive progress. Deviations in mechanics are inevitable as athletes try to move fast to complete\nthe workout. A coach must attend to each client, using as many different cueing strategies as possible or needed\nand offering encouragement and reinforcement of sound mechanics throughout the workout. A coach may find that\nhe or she actually has to slow an athlete down and/or lower the load, as well as potentially stop them, if there is no\nimprovement in mechanics across multiple repetitions. Movement change is not reserved only for the warm-up. It\nmust continue throughout the workout. A coach is expected to make athletes better during the workout.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and the coach during the workout. The athlete will receive increased fitness\nadaptations from appropriately increasing speed and load. In addition, he or she should be receiving feedback from\nthe coach on how to improve and refine movement. The coach benefits in this scenario by learning and developing\nseeing and correcting skills in a faster, more dynamic, and less-controlled environment. The ability to deliver action-\nable and effective cues for better movement improves with experience while coaching under high intensity. It is a\npractical, real-time learning opportunity that is focused on effective coaching strategies related to both the athlete\u2019s\nmechanics and motivation.\nPost-workout\nThe main purpose of the post-workout element is to cool down the athletes and program items that will aid in\nrecovery, regaining mental acuity, slowing heart rates and breathing, and facilitating full range of motion about the\njoints (i.e., regaining homeostasis). The coach may also have some secondary goals for this period, such as additiona\nskill work, fitness challenges, education for the athlete, and preparation of the space for the next class. Regardless\na well-conducted post-workout session must include a proper cool-down that leaves clients prepared for the rest of\ntheir day, capable and eager to return and full of appreciation for their accomplishments.\nSome examples of possible cool-down elements are described below. Generally, the cool-down should begin by just\nallowing the athletes to recover for a few minutes. While the athletes are warm and pliable, the cool-down is an excel-\nlent time to stretch or foam roll, especially the areas that were taxed heavily. This can aid recovery, reducing soreness\nwhile potentially helping athletes to gain new range of motion. A coach may leave this as an open period, allowing\nmembers to choose which drills are best for them. A coach-led session, however, ensures everyone has direction\nattention, motivation, and a sense of togetherness.\nA trainer may choose to include skill work at the end of a workout. This can include a review of the movements\nused, especially to correct errors that may have presented themselves during the workout. Using reduced speed and"}
{"294": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nload, the trainer can reinforce sound movement mechanics before the athlete leaves. If a trainer filmed an athlete\u2019s\nmovement during the workout, this period can include video playback to review his or her technique. It is also possible\nto work on a totally unrelated skill. While practice is more difficult after a workout due to fatigue, this is precisely why\nattempting new skills here can be beneficial (heightened neurological adaptations due to muscular fatigue).\nA post-workout may include a finisher\u2014an impromptu fitness test such as a maximum set of pull-ups, handstand\nwalking, or rope climbs\u2014anything. It can be part of an ongoing record or a competition, and it can be used as a moti-\nvational event or a chance to reinforce the unknown and unknowable nature of life\u2019s challenges. For example, finish-\ners may be grouped into teams or partners, or the challenge may be structured so one or two athletes compete at a\ntime and the rest of the class can cheer. As in a warm-up, a coach needs to be mindful that finishers do not become\na second workout, nor do they have to be part of every class.\nA coach can use the post-workout period to ensure athletes are recording their workouts. Especially on benchmark\ndays (including strength days), the coach should encourage members to write down their times, repetitions, loads\nand scaling or modifications. The coach should also be able to tell the members the last date the workout was com-\npleted for comparison.\nFinally, a coach can use this time as an educational opportunity to talk about nutrition, programming, scaling, \u201cWhat\nIs Fitness?\u201d or \u201cWhat is CrossFit?\u201d etc., all with the intention of creating smarter athletes.\nThe post-workout/cool-down period gives the coach time to survey athletes and look for mental faculties and visible\nsigns of injury or physical distress. A coach needs to pay attention to verbal and nonverbal cues that an athlete may\nbe under duress. This is also a time for the coach to engage in conversation with athletes by offering encouragement\nand feedback on performance and asking about their physical responses to the workout. Such conversations provide\nvaluable information about the coach\u2019s or facility\u2019s programming. These small connections also lay the groundwork\nfor building a strong community and meaningful relationships with one\u2019s members. The post-workout period is an\noften overlooked or rushed section of class, but it is valuable time, and a coach should use it wisely.\nTo be effective in each class, not only does a coach have to have capacity in all six areas discussed in the \u201cFoundations\nof Effective Training\u201d article, but one must also have a plan. This plan covers all aspects of the class to best improve\none\u2019s athletes with each training session while keeping them safe and excited to return for the next day. After each\nsession, an informal review and critique of one\u2019s own class performance can help the coach better prepare for sub-\nsequent sessions.
