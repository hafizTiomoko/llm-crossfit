{"4": "UNDERSTANDING CROSSFIT\nOriginally published in April 2007.\nThe aims, prescription, methodology, implementation, and adaptations of Cross-\nFit are collectively and individually unique, defining of CrossFit, and instrumental\nin our program\u2019s successes in diverse applications.\nAIMS\nFrom the beginning, the aim of CrossFit has been to forge a broad, general, and in-\nclusive fitness. We sought to build a program that would best prepare trainees for\nany physical contingency\u2014prepare them not only for the unknown but for the un-\nknowable. Looking at all sport and physical tasks collectively, we asked what physi-\ncal skills and adaptations would most universally lend themselves to performance\nadvantage. Capacity culled from the intersection of all sports demands would\nquite logically lend itself well to all sport. In sum, our specialty is not specializing.\nPRESCRIPTION\nCrossFit is: \u201cconstantly varied, high-intensity functional movement.\u201d This is our\nprescription. Functional movements are universal motor recruitment patterns;\nthey are performed in a wave of contraction from core to extremity; and they are\ncompound movements\u2014i.e., they are multi-joint. They are natural, effective, and\nefficient locomotors of body and external objects. But no aspect of functional\nmovements is more important than their capacity to move large loads over long\ndistances, and to do so quickly. Collectively, these three attributes (load, distance,\nand speed) uniquely qualify functional movements for the production of high pow-\ner. Intensity is defined exactly as power, and intensity is the independent variable\nmost commonly associated with maximizing the rate of return of favorable adap-\ntation to exercise. Recognizing that the breadth and depth of a program\u2019s stimulus\nwill determine the breadth and depth of the adaptation it elicits, our prescription\nof functionality and intensity is constantly varied. We believe that preparation for\nrandom physical challenges\u2014i.e., unknown and unknowable events\u2014is at odds\nwith fixed, predictable, and routine regimens."}
{"5": "METHODOLOGY\nThe methodology that drives CrossFit is entirely empirical. We believe that mean-\ningful statements about safety, efficacy, and efficiency, the three most important\nand interdependent facets to evaluate any fitness program, can be supported only\nby measurable, observable, repeatable data. We call this approach \u201cevidence-based\nfitness.\u201d CrossFit\u2019s methodology depends on full disclosure of methods, results,\nand criticisms, and we have employed the internet to support these values. Our\ncharter is open source, making co-developers out of participating coaches, ath-\nletes, and trainers through a spontaneous and collaborative online community.\nCrossFit is empirically driven, clinically tested, and community developed.\nIMPLEMENTATION We\u2019ve take\nIn implementation, CrossFit is, quite simply, a sport\u2014the Sport of Fitness.

The late Col.\nworkouts a\nJeff Cooper observed that \u201cthe fear of sporting failure is worse than the fear of\ndeath.\u201d It is our observation that men will die for points. Using whiteboards as distilled lo\nscoreboards, keeping accurate scores and records, running a clock, and precisely\nof motion,\ndefining the rules and standards for performance, we not only motivate unprece-\npower, wo\ndented output but derive both relative and absolute metrics at every workout; this\ndata has important value well beyond motivation. of action, fl\nspeed, and\nADAPTATIONS\npertinent m\nOur commitment to evidence-based fitness, publicly posting performance data,\nco-developing our program in collaboration with other coaches, and our open- to a single\nsource charter in general have well positioned us to garner important lessons from usually tim\nour program\u2014to learn precisely and accurately, that is, about the adaptations elic-\nthe Sport o\nited by CrossFit programming.

This is a discovery of great import and has come to motivate our program-\n\u2014COACH GLA\nming and refocus our efforts. This far-reaching increase in work capacity supports\nour initially stated aims of building a broad, general, and inclusive fitness program.\nIt also explains the wide variety of sport demands met by CrossFit, as evidenced"}

{"8": "Aside from the breadth or totality of fitness CrossFit seeks, our program is dis-\ntinctive, if not unique, in its focus on maximizing neuroendocrine response, de-\nveloping power, cross-training with multiple training modalities, constant training\nand practice with functional movements, and the development of successful\ndiet strategies.\nOur athletes are trained to bike, run, swim, and row at short, middle, and long\ndistances, guaranteeing exposure and competency in each of the three main met-\nabolic pathways.\nWe train our athletes in gymnastics from rudimentary to advanced movements,\ngarnering great capacity at controlling the body both dynamically and statically\nwhile maximizing strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility. We also place a heavy\nemphasis on Olympic weightlifting, having seen this sport\u2019s unique ability to devel-\nop an athlete\u2019s explosive power, control of external objects, and mastery of critical\nmotor recruitment patterns. And finally we encourage and assist our athletes to\nexplore a variety of sports as a vehicle to express and apply their fitness.\nAN EFFECTIVE APPROACH\nIn gyms and health clubs throughout the world the typical workout consists of\nisolation movements and extended aerobic sessions. The fitness community from\ntrainers to the magazines has the exercising public believing that lateral raises,\ncurls, leg extensions, sit-ups and the like combined with 20- to 40-minute stints on\nthe stationary bike or treadmill are going to lead to some kind of great fitness. Well,\nat CrossFit we work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high-in-\ntensity cardiovascular sessions. We have replaced the lateral raise with the push\npress, the curl with the pull-up, and the leg extension with the squat. For every\nlong-distance effort our athletes will do five or six at short distance. Why? Because\nfunctional movements and high intensity are radically more effective at eliciting\nnearly any desired fitness result. Startlingly, this is not a matter of opinion but\nsolid, irrefutable scientific fact, and yet the marginally effective old ways persist\nand are nearly universal. Our approach is consistent with what is practiced in elite"}
{"9": "training programs associated with major university athletic teams and profession-\nal sports. CrossFit endeavors to bring state-of-the-art coaching techniques to the\ngeneral public and athlete.\nIS THIS FOR ME?\nAbsolutely! Your needs and the Olympic athlete\u2019s differ by degree not kind. In-\ncreased power, speed, strength, cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, flexibility,\nstamina, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy are each important to the\nworld\u2019s best athletes and to our grandparents. The amazing truth is that the very\nsame methods that elicit optimal response in the Olympic or professional athlete\nwill optimize the same response in the elderly. Of course, we cannot load your\ngrandmother with the same squatting weight that we would assign an Olympic\nskier, but they both need to squat. In fact, squatting is essential to maintaining\nfunctional independence and improving fitness. Squatting is just one example\nof a movement that is universally valuable and essential yet rarely taught to any\nbut the most advanced of athletes. This is a tragedy. Through painstakingly thor-\nough coaching and incremental load assignment, CrossFit has been able to teach\neveryone who can care for himself or herself to perform safe-\nly and with maximum efficacy the same movements typically\nutilized by professional coaches in elite and certainly exclusive\nenvironments.\nWHO HAS BENEFITED FROM CROSSFIT?\nMany professional and elite athletes are participating in CrossFit.\nPrizefighters, cyclists, surfers, skiers, tennis players, triathletes\nand others competing at the highest levels are using CrossFit to\nadvance their core strength and conditioning, but that is not all.\nCrossFit has tested its methods on the sedentary, overweight,\npathological, and elderly and found that these special popula-\ntions met the same success as our stable of athletes. We call this\n\u201cbracketing.\u201d If our program works for Olympic skiers and over-\nweight, sedentary homemakers then it will work for you."}
{"10": "JUST WHAT IS A \u201cCORE STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING\u201d PROGRAM?\nCrossFit is a core strength and conditioning program in two distinct senses. First,\nwe are a core strength and conditioning program in the sense that the fitness\nwe develop is foundational to all other athletic\nneeds. This is the same sense in which the uni-\nversity courses required of a particular major\nare called the \u201ccore curriculum.\u201d This is the stuff\nthat everyone needs. Second, we are a \u201ccore\u201d\nstrength and conditioning program in the literal\nsense meaning the center of something. Much\nof our work focuses on the major functional axis\nof the human body, the extension and flexion\nof the hips and torso or trunk. The primacy of\ncore strength and conditioning in this sense is\nsupported by the simple observation that pow-\nerful hip extension alone is necessary and near-\nly sufficient for elite athletic performance. That\nis, our experience has been that no one without\nthe capacity for powerful hip extension enjoys\ngreat athletic prowess and nearly everyone we\nhave met with that capacity was a great athlete.\nRunning, jumping, punching, and throwing all\noriginate at the core. At CrossFit we endeavor\nto develop our athletes from the inside out, from core to extremity, which is, by\nthe way, how good functional movements recruit muscle, from the core to the\nextremities.\nCAN I ENJOY OPTIMAL HEALTH WITHOUT BEING AN ATHLETE?\nNo! Athletes experience a protection from the ravages of aging and disease that\nnon-athletes never find. For instance, 80-year-old athletes are stronger than\nnon-athletes in their prime at 25 years old. If you think that strength is not import-\nant, consider that strength loss is what puts people in nursing homes. Athletes\nhave greater bone density, stronger immune systems, less coronary heart dis-"}
{"11": "WHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO BE AN ATHLETE; I JUST WANT TO BE HEALTHY?\nYou are in luck. We hear this often, but the truth is that fitness, wellness, and pa-\nthology (sickness) are measures of the same entity: your health. There are a mul-\ntitude of measurable parameters that can be ordered from sick (pathological) to\nwell (normal) to fit (better than normal). These include but are not limited to blood\npressure, cholesterol, heart rate, body fat, muscle mass, flexibility, and strength.\nIt seems as though all of the body functions that can go awry have states that are\npathological, normal, and exceptional and that elite athletes typically show these\nparameters in the exceptional range. CrossFit\u2019s view is that fitness and health are\nthe same thing (see \u201cWhat Is Fitness? (Part 1)\u201d article). It is also interesting to notice\nthat the health professional maintains your health with drugs and surgery, each\nwith potentially undesirable side effects, whereas the CrossFit trainer typically\nachieves a superior result always with \u201cside benefit\u201d versus side effect.\nEXAMPLES OF CROSSFIT EXERCISES\nBiking, running, swimming, and rowing in an endless variety of drills. The clean and\njerk, snatch, squat, deadlift, push press, bench press, and power clean. Jumping,\nmedicine-ball throws and catches, pull-ups, dips, push-ups, handstands, presses\nto handstands, pirouettes, kips, cartwheels, muscle-ups, sit-ups, scales, and holds.\nWe make regular use of bikes, the track, rowing shells and ergometers, Olympic\nweight sets, rings, parallel bars, free exercise mats, horizontal bars, plyometrics\nboxes, medicine balls, and jump ropes.\nThere is not a strength and conditioning program anywhere that works with a\ngreater diversity of tools, modalities, and drills.\nWHAT IF I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF THIS?\nIt is a common sentiment to feel that because of the obligations of career and fami-\nly that you do not have the time to become as fit as you might like. Here is the good\nnews: World-class age group strength and conditioning is obtainable through an\nhour a day six days per week of training. It turns out that the intensity of training\nthat optimizes physical conditioning is not sustainable past 45 minutes to an hour.\nAthletes who train for hours a day are developing skill or training for sports that in-"}
{"12": "physical skills (cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, flexibility, strength,\npower, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy). The excessive aero-\nbic volume of the endurance athletes\u2019 training costs them in speed, power, and\nstrength to the point that their athletic competency has been compromised. No\ntriathlete is in ideal shape to wrestle, box, pole-vault, sprint, play any ball sport,\nfight fires, or do police work. Each of these requires a fitness level far beyond the\nneeds of the endurance athlete. None of this suggests that being a marathoner,\ntriathlete or other endurance athlete is a bad thing; just do not believe that training\nas a long-distance athlete gives you the fitness that is prerequisite to many sports.\nCrossFit considers the sumo wrestler, triathlete, marathoner, and powerlifter to\nbe \u201cfringe athletes\u201d in that their fitness demands are so specialized as to be incon-\nsistent with the adaptations that give maximum competency at all physical chal-\nlenges. Elite strength and conditioning is a compromise between each of the 10\nphysical adaptations. Endurance athletes do not balance that compromise.\nAEROBICS AND ANAEROBICS\nThere are three main energy systems that fuel all human activity. Almost all chang-\nes that occur in the body due to exercise are related to the demands placed on\nthese energy systems. Furthermore, the efficacy of any given fitness regimen may\nlargely be tied to its ability to elicit an adequate stimulus for change within these\nthree energy systems.\nEnergy is derived aerobically when oxygen is utilized to metabolize substrates de-\nrived from food and liberates energy. An activity is termed aerobic when the ma-\njority of energy needed is derived aerobically. These activities are usually greater\nthan 90 seconds in duration and involve low to moderate power output or inten-\nsity. Examples of aerobic activity include running on the treadmill for 20 minutes,\nswimming a mile, and watching TV.\nEnergy is derived anaerobically when energy is liberated from substrates in the\nabsence of oxygen. Activities are considered anaerobic when the majority of the\nenergy needed is derived anaerobically. In fact, properly structured, anaerobic ac-\ntivity can be used to develop a very high level of aerobic fitness without the muscle"}
{"13": "It warrants mention that in any activity all three energy systems are utilized\nthough one may dominate. The interplay of these systems can be complex, yet a\nsimple examination of the characteristics of aerobic versus anaerobic training can\nprove useful.\nCrossFit\u2019s approach is to judiciously balance anaerobic and aerobic exercise in a\nmanner that is consistent with the athlete\u2019s goals. Our exercise prescriptions ad-\nhere to proper specificity, progression, variation, and recovery to optimize\nadaptations.\nTHE OLYMPIC LIFTS, A.K.A., WEIGHTLIFTING\nThere are two Olympic lifts, the clean and jerk and\nthe snatch. Mastery of these lifts develops the\nsquat, deadlift, power clean, and split jerk while\nintegrating them into a single movement of un-\nequaled value in all of strength and conditioning.\nThe Olympic lifters are without a doubt the world\u2019s\nstrongest athletes.\nThese lifts train athletes to effectively activate more\nmuscle fibers more rapidly than through any other\nmodality of training. The explosiveness that results\nfrom this training is of vital necessity to every sport.\nPracticing the Olympic lifts teaches one to apply\nforce to muscle groups in proper sequence; i.e.,\nfrom the center of the body to its extremities (core\nto extremity). Learning this vital technical lesson benefits all athletes who need\nto impart force to another person or object, as is commonly required in near-\nly all sports.\nIn addition to learning to impart explosive forces, the clean and jerk and snatch\ncondition the body to receive such forces from another moving body both safely"}
{"14": "GYMNASTICS\nThe extraordinary value of gymnastics as a training modality lies in its reliance on\nthe body\u2019s own weight as the sole source of resistance. This places a unique premi-\num on the improvement of strength-to-weight ratio. Unlike other strength training\nmodalities, gymnastics and calisthenics allow for increases in strength only while\nincreasing strength-to-weight ratio!\nGymnastics develops pull-ups, squats, lunges, jumping, push-ups, and numerous\npresses to handstand, scales, and holds. These skills are unrivaled in their benefit\nto the physique, as evident in any competitive gymnast.\nAs important as the capacity of this modality is for strength development, it is with-\nout a doubt the ultimate approach to improving coordination, balance, agility, ac-\ncuracy, and flexibility. Through the use of numerous presses, handstands, scales,\nand other floor work, the gymnast\u2019s training greatly enhances kinesthetic sense.\nThe variety of movements available for inclusion in this modality probably exceeds\nthe number of exercises known to all non-gymnastic sport! The rich variety here\ncontributes substantially to CrossFit\u2019s ability to inspire great athletic confidence\nand prowess.\nFor a combination of strength, flexibility, well-developed physique, coordina-\ntion, balance, accuracy, and agility, the gymnast has no equal in the sports world.\nThe inclusion of this training modality is absurdly absent from nearly all train-\ning programs.\nROUTINES\nThere is no ideal routine! In fact, the chief value of any routine lies in abandon-\ning it for another. The CrossFit ideal is to train for any contingency. The obvious\nimplication is that this is possible only if there is a tremendously varied quality to\nthe breadth of stimulus. It is in this sense that CrossFit is a core strength and con-\nditioning program. Anything else is sport-specific training, not core strength and\nconditioning."}

Most important adaptations to exercise are in part or\ncompletely a result of a hormonal or neurological shift. Research has shown which\nexercise protocols maximize neuroendocrine responses. Earlier we faulted isola-\ntion movements as being ineffectual. Now we can tell you that one of the critical\nelements missing from these movements is that they invoke essentially no neuro-\nendocrine response.\nAmong the hormonal responses vital to athletic development are substantial\nincreases in testosterone, insulin-like growth factor, and human growth hor-\nmone.

{"18": "WHAT SHOULD I EAT?\nIn plain language, base your diet on garden vegetables (especially greens), meats,\nnuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar. That is about as simple as we\ncan get. Many have observed that keeping your grocery cart to the perimeter of the\ngrocery store while avoiding the aisles is a great way to protect your health. Food\nis perishable. The stuff with long shelf life is all suspect. If you follow these simple\nguidelines, you will benefit from nearly all that can be achieved through nutrition.\nTHE CAVEMAN OR PALEOLITHIC MODEL FOR NUTRITION\nModern diets are ill suited for our genetic composition. Evolution has not kept pace\nwith advances in agriculture and food processing, resulting in a plague of health\nproblems for modern man. Coronary heart disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoporo-\nsis, obesity, and psychological dysfunction have all been scientifically linked to a\ndiet too high in refined or processed carbohydrate. The caveman model is perfect-\nly consistent with CrossFit\u2019s prescription.\nWHAT FOODS SHOULD I AVOID?\nExcessive consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates is the primary culprit in\nnutritionally caused health problems. High-glycemic carbohydrates are those that\nraise blood sugar too rapidly. They include rice, bread, candy, potato, sweets, so-\ndas, and most processed carbohydrates. Processing can include bleaching, bak-\ning, grinding, and refining. Processing of carbohydrates greatly increases their\nglycemic index, a measure of their propensity to elevate blood sugar.\nWHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH HIGH-GLYCEMIC CARBOHYDRATES?\nThe problem with high-glycemic carbohydrates is that in excess they give an inor-\ndinate insulin response. Insulin is an essential hormone for life, yet acute, chron-\nic elevation of insulin leads to hyperinsulinism, which has been positively linked\nto obesity, elevated cholesterol levels, blood pressure, mood dysfunction, and a\nPandora\u2019s box of disease and disability.

But, where sports develop and require all 10\ngeneral skills simultaneously, they do so slowly compared to our strength and con-\nditioning regimen.

There is more opportunity of advancing athletic performance via\nadvancing GPP than there is in more sport-specific strength and conditioning\ntraining. For example, I am not sure why more pull-ups make for better skiers,\nbut they do. We have some theories why that occurs, but we do not actually need\nto know the mechanism. We are focused on advancing performance.\nSo the second model is a statistical model using skills and drills. I am looking for a\nbalance of capacity across training modalities.\nThe third model uses the three metabolic pathways. These are the three engines\nthat produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the currency of effort of all energy\noutput. Power is plotted on the Y-axis and duration of effort (time) on the X-axis.\nThe first pathway (phosphagen or phosphocreatine) is high powered and short\nduration. It can account for about 100 percent of max human output and taps out\nat about 10 seconds. The second pathway (lactate or glycolytic) is moderate pow-\nered, moderate duration. It accounts for approximately 70 percent of max pow-\ner output, peaks at about 60 seconds and terminates at 120 seconds. The third\npathway (oxidative or aerobic) is low powered, long duration. It accounts for ap-\nproximately 40 percent of max power output and does not fade in any reasonable\ntime for which I have the patience to measure. The phosphagen and the glycolytic\npathways are anaerobic; oxidative is aerobic. All three engines work all the time to\nsome extent. The degree to which each is active is dependent on the activity. One\nidles, while the other two rev; two will rev, one will idle, etc.\nOur thought is this: He or she is as fit as he or she is balanced in capacity in all\nthree of these engines. A human being is a vehicle with three engines. Suppose we\ndiscover there is a fourth engine; we want capacity there, too. We develop capacity\nin all engines through our prescription: constantly varied functional movement\nexecuted at high intensity.

{"42": "TECHNIQUE\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s Dec. 1, 2007, L1 lecture in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nIn no small part, what is behind this program is the quantification of fitness. This\nmeans we put a number on fitness: work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains. You can assess one\u2019s fitness by determining the area under his or her\nwork-capacity curve. This would be similar to a group of athletes competing in 25\nto 30 workouts. Include a range of activities\u2014like three pulls on the Concept2 row-\ner for average watts to a 10-mile run\u2014and a multitude of workouts in between.\nCompile their overall placing across these events, and everyone then has a reason-\nable metric of his or her total capacity.\nThis quantification of fitness is a part of a broader concept that is at the heart of\nthis movement: We call it evidence-based fitness. This means measurable, observ-\nable, repeatable data is used in analyzing and assessing a fitness program. There\nare three meaningful components to analysis of a fitness program: safety, efficacy,\nand efficiency.\nThe efficacy of a program means, \u201cWhat is the return?\u201d Maybe a fitness program\nadvertises that it will make you a better soccer player. There needs to be evidence\nof this supported by measurable, observable, repeatable data. For CrossFit, we\nwant to increase your work capacity across broad time and modal domains. This is\nthe efficacy of this program. What are the tangible results? What is the adaptation\nthat the program induces?\nEfficiency is the time rate of that adaptation. Maybe the fitness program adver-\ntises that it can deliver 50 pull-ups. There is a big difference whether it takes six\nmonths versus nine years to achieve that.\nSafety is how many people end up at the finish line. Suppose I have a fitness pro-\ngram.

{"43": "For the qualification of movement there are four common terms: mechanics,\ntechnique, form and style. I will not delve into them with too much detail: The\ndistinction is not that important. I use both technique and form somewhat inter-\nchangeably, although there is a slightly nuanced distinction.\nWhen I talk about angular velocity, momentum, leverage, origin or insertion of\nmuscles, torque, force, power, relative angles, we are taking about mechanics.\nWhen I speak to the physics of movement, and especially the statics and less so\nthe dynamics, I am looking at the mechanics.\nTechnique is the method to success for completion of a movement. For example, if\nyou want to do a full twisting dismount on the rings, the technique would be: pull,\nlet go, look, arm up, turn, shoulder drop, etc. Technique includes head posture and\nbody posture. And there are effective and less effective techniques. Technique\nincludes the mechanics, but it is in the macro sense of \u201chow do you complete the\nmovement without the physics?\u201d\nForm is the normative value: This is good or this is bad\u2014\u201cyou should\u201d or \u201cyou\nshouldn\u2019t\u201d applied to mechanics and technique.\nStyle is essentially the signature to a movement; that is, that aspect of the move-\nment that is fairly unique to you. The best of the weightlifting coaches can look at\nthe bar path during a lift and tell you which lifter it is. There are aspects to all of our\nmovements that define us like your thumbprint. It is the signature. To be truly just\nthe signature, style elements have no bearing on form, technique or mechanics.\nStyle does not enter into the normative assessment, is not important to technique,\nand does not alter substantially the physics.\nThese four terms are all qualifications to movement. I want to speak generally to\ntechnique and form to include all of this, but what we are talking about here is the\nnon-quantification of output; that is, how you move.\nBy taking power or work capacity as our primary value for assessing technique\u2014"}

For example, you can use an\nelectromyogram and see with what force the biceps shortens. If you are defining\nstrength as contractile potential, you may end up with the guy with enormous\ncontractile potential\u2014but not knowing the technique of the clean, the jerk, the\ndeadlift, he cannot do as much work.\nWe, however, do not take contractile potential as the gold standard for strength.\nStrength is the productive application of force. If you cannot complete work, if you\ncannot express strength as power, if strength cannot be expressed as productive\nresult, it does not count. Having enormous biceps and quadriceps is useless if you\ncannot run, jump, lift, throw, press.\nThis is related to safety, efficacy and efficiency because technique (quality of\nmovement) is the heart of maximizing each of these.\nHe or she who knows how to do these movements when confronted with them\nwill get a better result in terms of safety.

I want\nto look at typing, shooting, playing the violin, NASCAR driving and CrossFit. What\nthese domains have in common is that a marked proficiency is associated with\nspeed. Being able to shoot accurately and quickly is better than quickly or accurately.\nYou may try to get a job as a typist because you do not make any mistakes. How-\never, for this perfection, you type at a rate of 20 words a minute and only use two\nfingers. You will never get hired. Playing the violin fast and error-free is critical for\na virtuoso. However, someone who gets through \u201cFlight of the Bumblebee\u201d in 12\nminutes is not there yet. A NASCAR driver wants to both drive fast and not wreck.\nIn CrossFit, a perfectly exquisite Fran is worthless if it takes 32 minutes.\nAnd yet, it is presented to CrossFit coaches as, \u201cShould I use good form or should I\ndo it quickly?\u201d I do not like my choices. One is impossible without the other.\nTechnique and speed are not at odds with one another, where \u201cspeed\u201d is related\nto all the quantification of the movement: power, force, distance, time. They are\nseemingly at odds. It is a misapprehension. It is an illusion.\nCan you learn to drive fast without wrecking? Can you learn to type fast without\nmaking errors? Can you shoot quickly without missing? Eventually, but not in the\nlearning. One is impossible without the other.\nYou will not learn to type fast without typing where you make a ton of errors and\nthen work to reduce the errors at that speed. Then you go faster, and then again\npull the errors back in, then go faster and pull the errors back in. You drive faster\nand faster and then you spin out in the infield or you hit the wall.\nIf you are a race driver and you have never spun out, gone out in the infield or nev-\ner been in a wreck, you are not very good.

First, at that speed I want you to fix your tech-\nnique. What you need to do is continuously and constantly advance the margins\nat which form falters.\nIt may be that initially at 10,000 foot-pounds per minute my technique is perfect,\nbut it falls apart at 12,000 foot-pounds per minute. Work at that 10,000 to 12,000\nfoot-pounds per minute mark to fix the form, and soon enough you will have great\ntechnique at 12,000 foot-pounds per minute. The next step is to achieve that tech-\nnique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute.\nAt first, the technique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute will suffer. Then you must\nnarrow it in. That is the process. It is ineluctable. It is unavoidable. There is nothing\nI can do about it. That is not my rule.\nWe are the technique people. We drill technique incessantly, but simultaneously I\nwant you to go faster. You will learn to work at higher intensity with good technique\nonly by ratcheting up the intensity to a point where good technique is impossible.\nThis dichotomy means that it is impossible at the limits of your capacity to obey\nevery little detail and nuance of technique. Some of the refined motor-recruitment\npatterns are not going to always look perfect.\nI do not know of a domain where speed matters and technique is not at the heart\nof it. In every athletic endeavor where we can quantify the output, there is incred-\nible technique at the highest levels of performance.\nSuppose someone set the new world record for the shot put, but his technique was\npoor.

(Glu-\ncagon is the counter-regulatory hormone to insulin: It releases the energy out of\nthe cells.) And one of the things that insulin puts into cells is fat.\nYou can see that the way to get your insulin level too high (hyperinsulinism) is to\neat too much carbohydrate. How much carbohydrate is that? In the qualitative\nsense, your insulin level is \u201ctoo high\u201d if it is driving up your blood pressure, mak-\ning you fat or reducing your ability to suppress blood sugar after eating carbo-\nhydrate.

High-density lipoproteins (HDL\ncholesterol), for instance: At less than 35 mg/dL you have a problem, 50 mg/dL is\nnice, and 75 mg/dL is a whole lot better.

{"67": "TYPICAL CROSSFIT BLOCK PRESCRIPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS\nTo best understand the Zone Diet, CrossFit athletes should read Dr. Barry Sears\u2019\nbook \u201cEnter the Zone.\u201d This article gives more information regarding block pre-\nscriptions and fat adjustments for CrossFit athletes.\nThe chart based on sex and body type in the article \u201cZone Meal Plans\u201d is perfect\nfor those who want to start the Zone Diet. If the athlete chooses the wrong block\nsize and does not obtain the desired results, the plan can be modified after a few\nweeks. Errors in block selection might slow progress, but initial errors are offset by\nthe huge value in starting a practice of weighing and measuring intake.\nSears details a more precise method to calculate one\u2019s block prescription in \u201cEnter\nthe Zone.\u201d It is:\nZone block prescription = lean body mass (lb.) x activity level (g/lb. of lean\nbody mass) / 7 (g protein/block)\nThe activity level ranges on a scale of 0-1. For those who work out several days a\nweek and do not have a labor-intensive job, the activity level should be 0.7 (most\nCrossFit athletes). By dividing 0.7 by 7 g in the equation, this simplifies to a Zone\nblock prescription that is 10 percent of his or her lean mass.\nThe activity factor should increase if the athlete does CrossFit two or more times a\nday, trains for another sport in addition to CrossFit, or holds a strenuous daily job\n(e.g., construction, farming, etc., and potentially coaching, if on one\u2019s feet all day).\nAlthough CrossFit workouts are relatively intense, they are not long in duration.\nAn individual does not need to increase the activity level value based on intensity\nalone; activity volume determines activity factor.\nSAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE ZONE BLOCK PRESCRIPTION\nSuppose an athlete is 185 lb. (84 kg) with 16 percent body fat. He does CrossFit five\ndays per week and works in a typical office environment. A sample calculation of"}
{"68": "TABLE 1. MACRONUTRIENT AND CALORIE COMPOSITION\nFOR 15 BLOCKS A DAY\nProtein 15 blocks x 7 g = 105 g (420 calories)\nCarbohydrate 15 blocks x 9 g = 135 g (540 calories)\nFat 15 blocks x 3 g = 45 g (405 calories)\nTotal Calories = 1,365\nNote the total calories presented here are underestimated due to hidden calories.\nMost foods are classified by a single macronutrient, despite the presence of some\nother macronutrients (e.g., nuts are classified as a fat but have some protein and\ncarbohydrate calories). These less predominant macronutrients for each source\nare not included in the total calorie calculations.\nThis athlete could also choose to round up to 16 blocks, particularly if he or she is\nmore likely to have compliance issues. The Zone prescription is a calorie-restrictive\ndiet and can be especially difficult for new adopters. When one\u2019s calculation has a\ndecimal value, rounding up to the next whole block might result in slower progress\nbut produce better long-term compliance. Once the athlete has become accus-\ntomed to the diet, then the total blocks can be rounded down to 15, particularly if\ndesired body composition has not been achieved.\nINCREASING FAT INTAKE\nThe caloric restriction leans out the athlete while providing enough protein and\ncarbohydrate for typical CrossFit activity levels. However, the athlete can become\ntoo lean. The athlete is considered \u201ctoo lean\u201d when performance decreases in\ncombination with continued weight loss. \u201cToo lean\u201d should not be based on body\nweight or appearance alone. When a loss of mass coincides with a drop in perfor-\nmance, the athlete needs to add calories to the diet. This can be accomplished by\ndoubling the fat intake (Table 2)."}

{"70": "SUPPLEMENTATION\nWhole, unprocessed foods are the best source of both macronutrients and micro-\nnutrients in terms of composition, variety, and density, such that supplementation\nis generally not recommended. We contend that eating a diet composed of known\nquantities and of high-quality whole foods is the most important aspect of nutri-\ntion for improved performance and health. Not only are supplements generally\npoorer nutrient sources, but they are also an unnecessary focus for someone not\nfollowing our basic diet plan of weighed and measured meat and vegetables, etc.\nHowever, we find one supplement beneficial enough to make a blanket recom-\nmendation: fish oil. Fish oil provides omega-3 fatty acids, which are a type of poly-\nunsaturated fat.\nPhysiological fats are known as triglycerides in biological terms; they are composed\nof a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached (Figure 1). The attached fatty\nacids are mixtures of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats. Al-\nthough one fatty acid is prominent in each food, all three are represented to some\ndegree. Figure 2 provides a summary of the types of fat and example food sources.\nThe two types of polyunsaturated fats found most frequently in foods are ome-\nga-3 and omega-6 fats. Classifying a fatty acid as omega-3 versus omega-6 is\ndependent on chemical structure. Polyunsaturated fats are sources of the two\nessential fatty acids, meaning they must be obtained from the diet. They are al-\npha-linolenic acid (ALA) (an omega-3) and linoleic acid (LA) (an omega-6). Ome-\nga-3 fats are known as \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d fats, and omega-6 fats are known as\n\u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d fats based on their physiological functions. Both are needed\nin relatively equal quantities."}
{"71": "Figure 2. Summary of Fatty Acids and Example Food Sources."}
{"72": "Fish-oil supplementation improves the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids\nand reduces the inflammatory responses in the body. Fish oil provides two types\nof omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid\n(DHA), the form of omega-3 fats preferred by the brain and body. The body can\nconvert ALA to EPA and DHA, but the conversion process is inefficient. Some prac-\ntitioners have recommended a combined daily intake on the order of 3 grams of\nEPA and DHA for an otherwise healthy individual, although the exact amount is\ndictated by one\u2019s total omega-6 intake. Each brand of fish oil has a different con-\ncentration of EPA and DHA per serving as indicated on the label. Individuals might\nhave to take multiple servings to get 3 grams of EPA and DHA, as brands might\ninclude omega-3s that are neither EPA nor DHA (e.g., ALA). Flax seed or oil is not an\nappropriate supplement for omega-3s. Flax is a good source of ALA, but because\nof the poor conversion to EPA and DHA, it is not recommended. If the individual is\nvegan, DHA can be obtained with algae oil.\nResearch has indicated positive health benefits by supplementing with fish oil.\nOmega-3 fats help increase the fluidity of cell membranes, and research has in-\ndicated supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular function,\nnervous-system function, immune health, memory, and mood issues. Omega 3s\nalso function as an anti-coagulant, so military personnel should consider remov-\ning fish oil supplements from their diet a couple of weeks prior to deployment.\nIt might also be appropriate for those with an upcoming surgery to stop taking\nfish oil two weeks from that date. These individuals should talk with their doctor\nregarding these circumstances.\nIt is possible to avoid omega-3 supplementation depending on food intake, al-\nthough the individual needs to be fastidious with his or her diet. This could be\naccomplished by avoidance of all vegetable oils (which are used at most every\nrestaurant), and nuts and seeds. Meat would have to be grass-fed and eggs pas-\nture-raised, and wild-caught fish should be consumed a few times a week. Be-\ncause this is not practical for many people, supplementation is effective.\nBesides the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3s in the diet, the total amount of poly-"}

The monostructural\nmetabolic conditioning activities are commonly referred to as \u201ccardio,\u201d the pur-\npose of which is primarily to improve cardiorespiratory capacity and stamina.\nThey are repetitive, cyclical movements that could be sustained for long periods\nof time. The gymnastics modality comprises body-weight exercises/elements or\ncalisthenics, and its primary purpose is to improve body control by improving\nneurological components such as coordination, balance, agility, and accuracy, and\nto improve functional upper-body capacity and trunk strength. The weightlifting\nmodality comprises the most important weight-training basics, Olympic lifts and\npowerlifting, where the aim is primarily to increase strength, power, and hip/leg\ncapacity. This category includes any exercise with the addition of an external load.\nTable 2 gives the common exercises used by our program, separated by modality,\nin fleshing out the routines.\nFor metabolic conditioning the exercises are run, bike, row, and jump rope. The\ngymnastics modality includes air squats, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, handstand\npush-ups, rope climbs, muscle-ups, presses to handstands, back/hip extensions,\nsit-ups, and jumps (vertical, box, broad, etc.). The weightlifting modality includes\nTABLE 2. EXERCISES BY MODALITY"}
{"76": "deadlifts, cleans, presses, snatches, clean and jerks, medicine-ball drills and\nthrows, and kettlebell swings.\nThe elements, or exercises, chosen for each modality were selected for their\nfunctionality, neuroendocrine response, and overall capacity to dramatically and\nbroadly impact the human body.\nWORKOUT STRUCTURE\nThe workout structure varies by the inclusion of one, two, or three modalities for\neach day (Table 3). Days 1, 5, and 9 are each single-modality workouts whereas days\n2, 6, and 10 include two modalities each (couplets), and finally, days 3, 7, and 11 use\nthree modalities each (triplets). In every case each modality is represented by a\nsingle exercise or element; i.e., each M, W, and G represents a single exercise from\nmetabolic conditioning, weightlifting, and gymnastics modalities respectively.\nWhen the workout includes a single exercise (days 1, 5, and 9) the focus is on a\nsingle exercise or effort. When the element is the single \u201cM\u201d (day 1) the workout is\na single effort and is typically a long, slow, distance effort. When the modality is a\nsingle \u201cG\u201d (day 5) the workout is practice of a single skill, and typically this skill is\nsufficiently complex to require great practice but might not be yet suitable for in-\nclusion in a timed workout because performance is not yet adequate for efficient\ninclusion. When the modality is the single \u201cW\u201d (day 9) the workout is a single lift and\ntypically performed at high weight and low repetition. It is worth repeating that the\nfocus on days 1, 5, and 9 is single efforts of \u201ccardio\u201d at long distance; improving\nhigh-skill, more complex gymnastics movements; and single/low-rep heavy\nweightlifting basics, respectively. This is not the day to work sprints, pull-ups, or\nhigh-repetition clean and jerks \u2014the other days would be more appropriate.\nTABLE 3.

{"79": "SCALING CROSSFIT\nCrossFit workouts, and especially those on CrossFit.com, are designed to chal-\nlenge even the most advanced athlete. Many athletes need to \u201cscale\u201d (i.e., modify)\nthe workouts for the safest implementation of the program. Finding a CrossFit\naffiliate is one way to receive proper coaching and guidance through this pro-\ncess. In absence of an experienced trainer, this article presents some basic\nconcepts for scaling workouts particularly for beginners. Scaling for other pop-\nulations (e.g., advanced or injured athletes) is discussed in greater detail at the\nLevel 2 Certificate Course, as well as in the Online Scaling Course.\nAthletes will need to scale workouts for variable lengths of time. One\u2019s athletic\nbackground, as well as his or her current health and fitness capacity, dictates how\nlong scaling is necessary. The methodology presented here can be used indefi-\nnitely, but a month is the minimum period for which significant scaling should be\napplied. This introductory period serves two purposes: 1) it develops competency\nof movements used in CrossFit; and 2) it appropriately exposes the athlete to grad-\nual increases in intensity and volume.\nMECHANICS AND CONSISTENCY FIRST\nCrossFit\u2019s charter for creating the most optimal balance of safety, efficacy, and\nefficiency is: mechanics, consistency, then\u2014and only then\u2014intensity. The initial\nexposure to CrossFit is when movement mechanics should be prioritized over in-\ntensity. And for some, just practicing the movements will be intense. It is impera-\ntive that the movements can be performed correctly and consistently before load\nand speed are added. While intensity is an important part of the CrossFit program,\nit is added after movement proficiency is established. Ignoring this order increas-\nes the risk for injury and potentially blunts long-term progress, especially if poor\nmechanics are combined with load.\nSCALING EFFECTIVELY: PRESERVE THE STIMULUS\nWhen scaling workouts, the main principle to follow is \u201cpreserve the stimulus.\u201d"}
{"80": "Intensity and Volume\nTwo factors need to be scaled for every beginner: 1) intensity; and 2) volume. A\nprudent method for beginners is reducing intensity and/or volume by half for at\nleast two weeks. Depending on how the athlete progresses, volume and intensity\ncan be gradually increased in the following weeks, months, and years.\nIntensity refers to the amount of power an athlete generates. Intensity may be\nmodified in three ways: 1) load; 2) speed; and/or 3) volume.\nLoad is the variable to scale first; scaling the load is an easy way to preserve the\nstimulus relative to an athlete\u2019s capacity. Load is also the most common variable\nmodified after the beginner period. Especially for a conditioning workout, the ath-\nlete should use a load that ensures he or she is able to complete the first set or\nround without compromising form or reaching muscular failure. Determining ap-\npropriate loads for newer athletes requires some estimation, and scaling will not\nalways be perfect. Often, loads for newer athletes will be less than 50 percent\nof the prescribed load, especially if an athlete is new to lifting weights. Coaches\nshould err on the side of scaling too much rather than not enough, particularly for\nnewer athletes.\nSpeed tends to be more self-modulated due to the athlete\u2019s fitness level, although\na coach can modulate speed based on the mechanics demonstrated. A coach\nmight have to slow an athlete down to achieve the correct mechanics. Similarly,\ncoaches might have to encourage an athlete who is moving well to move faster,\nthough this is less common when working with beginners (see \u201cTechnique\u201d article).\nVolume is the total amount of work accomplished by the athlete. Depending on\nthe workout, volume can be lowered by reducing: 1) time; 2) reps/rounds; and/or\n3) distance.\nNewer CrossFit athletes might attempt to struggle through a workout where\nthe volume of repetitions (or load, above) is beyond their current capacity. For\nexample, an advanced CrossFit athlete might complete Fran in 2 minutes. That"}
{"81": "Movements\nWhen a movement cannot be performed at all, it can be substituted. CrossFit\nsuggests modifying this variable last because avoiding a movement prevents an\nindividual from developing proficiency in it. An athlete or trainer should first try re-\nducing the load before substituting the movement. If the workout calls for snatch-\nes at 95 lb., for example, it is generally preferable that the athlete performs the\nsnatches with a PVC pipe instead of substituting 95-lb. overhead squats.\nComplete movement substitutions should be considered when a physical limita-\ntion or injury is present, or when the load cannot be reduced. When selecting a\nsubstitute movement, trainers should try to preserve the original movement\u2019s\nfunction and range of motion as best they can. When determining movement sub-\nstitutions consider:\n1) Whether the movement is primarily driven by the lower body or\nupper body.\n2) The movement function (e.g., push versus pull).\n3) The range of motion used by the movement (specifically of the hips,\nknees, and ankles).\n4) The plane of movement.\nParticularly in the case of injury, a complete movement replacement might be nec-\nessary. Consideration of these variables can help trainers select a movement sub-\nstitution or replacement that is as similar as possible to the prescribed movement.\nA SAMPLE WEEK OF SCALING\nThis section outlines five typical CrossFit workouts. For each Workout of the Day\n(WOD), scaled workouts are presented with modifications to volume, load, and\nmovements. Some of the rationale for the options is also described. These scaled\nworkouts should be considered but three examples of the many options available.\nThey do not take the place of scaled workouts created by an experienced trainer\nwho is relying on intuition and detailed knowledge of a specific athlete."}

Doing so will allow the individual to achieve almost the same volume\nwhile he or she develops new skills and/or is exposed to heavier elements.\nCONCLUSION\nAthletes and their trainers should focus on movement proficiency before adding\nspeed and load.

As a matter of terminology, when we refer to the\n\u201csquat\u201d we are talking about an unladen, body-weight-only squat. When we wish\nto refer to a weighted squat we will use the term back squat, overhead squat, or\nfront squat, referring to those distinct weighted squats. Training with the front,\nback, and overhead squats before the weightless variant has been mastered re-\ntards athletic potential and compromises safety and efficacy.\nWhen has the squat been mastered? This is a good question. It is fair to say that\nthe squat is mastered when both technique and performance are superior. This\nsuggests that none of the points of performance are deficient and fast multiple\nreps are possible. Our favorite standard for fast multiple reps would be the Ta-\nbata squat (20 seconds on/10 seconds off repeated 8 times) with the weakest of\neight intervals being between 18 and 20 reps. Do not misunderstand \u2014we are\nlooking for 18-20 perfect squats in 20 seconds, rest for 10, and repeat seven\nmore times for a total of eight intervals.\nThe most common faults to look for are surrendering of the lumbar curve at the\nbottom, not breaking the parallel plane with the hips, slouching in the chest and\nshoulders, lifting the heels, and not fully extending the hip at the top (Figure 1).\nDo not even think about weighted squats until none of these faults belong to you.\nA relatively small angle of hip extension, while indicative of a beginner\u2019s or weak\nsquat and caused by weak hips extensors, is not strictly considered a fault as\nlong as the lumbar spine is neutral.\nCAUSES OF A BAD SQUAT\n1) Weak glute/hamstring. The glutes and hams are responsible for powerful\nhip extension, which is the key to the athletic performance universe.\n2) Poor engagement, weak control, and no awareness of glute and\nhamstring.

{"124": "SUMMARY\nFrom shoulder press to push jerk the movements become increasingly more ath-\nletic, functional, and suited to heavier loads. The progression also increasingly\nrelies on the power zone. In the shoulder press, the power zone is used for stabi-\nlization only. In the push press the power zone provides not only stability but also\nthe primary impetus in both the dip and drive. In the push jerk the power zone is\ncalled on for the dip, drive, second dip, and squat. The role of the hip is increased\nin each exercise.\nWith the push press you will be able to drive overhead as much as 30 percent more\nweight than with the shoulder press. The push jerk will allow you to drive as much\nas 30 percent more overhead than you would with the push press.\nIn effect the hip is increasingly recruited through the progression of lifts to assist\nthe arms and shoulders in raising loads overhead. After mastering the push jerk\nyou will find that it will unconsciously displace the push press as your method of\nchoice when going overhead.\nThe second dip on the push jerk will become lower and lower as you both master\nthe technique and increase the load. At some point in your development, the loads\nwill become so substantial that the upper body cannot contribute but a fraction\nto the movement, at which point the catch becomes very low and an increasing\namount of the lift is accomplished by the overhead squat.\nOn both the push press and jerk, the \u201cdip\u201d is critical to the entire movement. The\nstomach is held very tightly and the resultant turnaround from dip to drive is sud-\nden, explosive, and violent.\nTRY THESE\n1) Start with 95 lb. and push press or push jerk 15 straight repetitions, rest\n30 seconds, and repeat for total of 5 sets of 15 repetitions each. Go up\nin weight only when you can complete all 5 sets with only 30 seconds of\nrest between each and do not pause in any set."}

{"133": "THE GLUTE-HAM DEVELOPER (GHD)\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s March 18, 2007, L1 lecture in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nOur definition of core strength is midline stabilization. In profile, there is a ref-\nerence line that trisects the spine and bisects the pelvis. Midline stabilization is\nthe ability to maintain rigidity, stability, and a lack of deflection about that line\n(Figure 1). This translates to improved efficiency and performance and greater\npower output.\nIt is critical to the deadlift, to the laden squat, to the shoulder press, and to any\nsport. In a swimmer\u2019s stroke\u2014when the left leg kicks and right arm pulls\u2014if the\ntorso deviates to one side, you lose energy. Energy is lost in its deflection, wheth-\ner throwing a punch, riding a bicycle, or squatting. The abdominals, with the hip\nflexors, control one side of the torso, with the hip extensors and erectors involved\non the other side.\nHowever, what we have in modern physical culture is an excessive awareness\nand focus on the anterior and not on the posterior. As a culture of athletes and\nnon-athletes alike, we are unfortunately frontally fixated. Pecs\u2014what about the\nrhomboids? Abs\u2014what about the erectors? Quads\u2014what about the glute-ham-\nstring? And for the best of functional movement\u2014punch, jump, throw, run\u2014the\nimpetus comes out of the posterior.\nWe see communities where there is a very deliberate and concerted effort to min-\nimize hip-flexor involvement in exercise. And yet, by insertion and origin, by me-\nchanical position and advantage, and just kinematically, the hip flexors, have\nseveral times the contraction capacity that is estimated of the abdominals. All of it:\nhip extensors, hip flexors, trunk flexors, and ex-\ntensors are essential to midline stabilization. The\nabdominals are just one part of the story.\nFor core strength (midline stabilization), we are"}
{"134": "pelvis relationship. About the only thing that we see them paying attention to is\ndynamic trunk-flexion work. There is no trunk-extension work, no hip-extension\nwork, and hip flexion is deliberately limited. Some of these communities also have\nproblems with chronic back injury, which comes at no surprise. If there is anything\nto \u201cmuscle balance,\u201d it makes sense. In how many communities are they doing an\nequal number of deadlifts and squats to their sit-ups? Most of the military/law-en-\nforcement PT is completely devoid of full-range-of-motion hip extension. Rucking,\nrunning, jumping jacks\u2014all will not do it. The run, pull-up, sit-up, push-up, lath-\ner-rinse-repeat PT has no real good core movement. The crunch does not count.\nWhile a cumbersome and space-taking piece of gear, the GHD has been essential\nto our work. We have four of them in 2,500 square feet, so one every 600 feet.\nWe use the GHD for four exercises to heighten awareness and develop capacity\nat midline stabilization. The punchline to the story is that static contractions that\nstabilize the midsection are the most important and functional (powerful) muscu-\nlar contractions in that region. Static contractions for midline stabilization are the\nbest ab exercises known. No amount of crunches are ever going to get you to the\nsame end point as the L-sit, overhead squat, deadlift, etc.\nWhat we suspect is that if you could sequentially fire the abs with the same force\nin any kind of dynamic pattern, you would have the ability to seriously injure your\nspine. If you could ever crunch with the same force that you can stabilize, you\nwould be able to break your back at will. We have come hardwired unable to do\nthat\u2014that is my guess.\nThe movements are presented in the order in which they should be developed in\na client. The first thing is a simple hip extension: articulate at the hip only, maintain-\ning the distance from xiphoid process to pubic bone. There is no shortening of the\ntrunk. There is no trunk flexion,\njust hip extension and flexion\nwhile maintaining midline sta-\nbilization. The erectors are be-\ning used statically, and the"}

Then the back extends sequentially along the spine from \u201csouth\nto north\u201d (Figure 5).\nThis movement does a lot for a coach. It heightens a neurological awareness. It\nallows me to introduce some essential vernacular to the client. If we do not have\ncues that allow me to talk about hip flexion, trunk flexion, hip extension, trunk ex-\ntension, I am fairly worthless with a client. Very early, get clients to know terms. Be\nable to call it out and get the response you need.\nThis movement demonstrates tremendous control. There is hip flexion, hip ex-\ntension, trunk flexion and trunk extension in a combo \u201csnake\u201d move. Using those\nmuscles is essential for midline stabilization and working the posterior.\nThe fourth movement on the GHD is a sit-up but involves no trunk flexion. For the\nGHD sit-up, the pad is set so that the pelvis is free, and the athlete descends back\nto touch the ground and then comes back to seated. More than a few exercise\nphysiologists and certified trainers have observed that this movement is pure hip\nflexion and consequently asserted \u201cthere\u2019s no abs in that.\u201d\nBut what the abs are doing in this exercise is midline stabilization.\nBefore having clients perform the GHD sit-up, ensure they have demonstrated ca-\npacity in the hip extension, back extension, and hip-and-back extension. Even still,\ntheir first GHD sit-ups should be performed in a shortened range of motion, with\nthe trainer spotting behind them (Figure 6). That might be it for the first dose. Once\nthey come back and you can determine the effect from that dose, increase the\nrange of motion and volume as their capacity allows.\nTo perform a GHD sit-up, there is some leg flexion in the descent. Then, the leg\nextends dramatically and pulls the athlete to seated (Figure 7). Conversely, if the\nathlete does not extend the leg to come to seated, the primary movers are the hip"}
{"142": "The force with which an athlete comes up is amazing. Rather than being pulled\nfrom the psoas alone, which is a fairly dysfunctional kind of pull, the athlete uses\nthe full complement of hip-flexor musculature. Any time you are using a fraction of\nthe primary movers responsible for that articulation, it is not natural, not function-\nal, and contrary to nature. Not extending the leg can also be a little irritating to the\nlow back due to this shearing force on the lumbar spine. Performed correctly, the\nmovement is not irritating to the low back. Straightening that leg enables profound\nmusculature to lift from the pelvis.\nThere are people who have this irritation in the spine from a shear force. If you can\nteach them to extend the legs to work the full complement of hip flexors, we will\nmove the margins where this irritation occurs from 3 reps to 4 reps to 10 reps and\nso on. That is rehabilitation. That is neuromuscular re-education.\nThere is an adjunct movement to GHD sit-up in which the athlete is dynamic in the\ntrunk and static in the hip. It is the AbMat sit-up, where we deliberately take the\nhip flexors out of the equation and work the torso dynamically. The hip flexors are\nworking statically or possibly to no significant degree.\nTo do this, the hip flexors need to be removed from the line of action. The fat part\nof the AbMat goes toward the glutes, and the athlete puts the bottom of his or her\nsoles together with the knees butterflied. This positioning makes the hip flexors\ntangential to the line of action; i.e., they cannot do any productive work. This is\ndone deliberately. Then the athlete slowly and under control comes to seated by\ncontracting the abdominals. This is a very dynamic bit of trunk flexion and the hip\nflexors are removed (Figure 8).\nAs the athlete fails, adduct and extend the legs to some degree. This creates more\npurchase for the hip flexors and brings them into the line of action. This allows the\nathlete to modulate the assistance and keep each rep focused on the midsection.\nIf reps are performed slowly and deliberately, most athletes will fail a sit-up with-\nout an AbMat. The failure is not necessarily a neuromuscular failure. It is not"}

But that lum-\nbar region is fairly inflexible, and all that range of motion that is available moves\none from spinally extended through to neutral. There is no more shortening or\nflexion to it; it is not enough to sit up.\nWithout the AbMat, the sit-up is a biphasic movement. While I have solid contact,\nI use upper rectus and create enough momentum to throw the load to the hip\nflexors, where I have more connection. This means that the full rectus has little\nstimulus\u2014it is pulling me from spinally extended through to neutral, but absent\nof any load. The upper rectus is worked where there is a fulcrum, so the back flat-\ntens, but it is the hip flexors that pull me to seated. There is no amount of sit-ups\nyou can do on the ground that is ever going to work you from pubic bone to about\n3 or 4 inches above the belly button. The AbMat moves the athlete from spinally\nextended through to neutral in the lumbar spine against a load.\nHow big would your bench press get if you only pushed air? You would get as\nstrong as your abs will with a ground-based sit-up. With or without the pad, there\nis the same contraction and range of motion in the midsection. Without the pad,\nthe fibers shortened but there was no load and no real work completed. With the\npad, they got the same motion but under a load, and it produced fruitful work.\nThe two sit-ups, GHD and AbMat, complement each other beautifully. One is dy-\nnamic in the hips and static in the trunk; the other is dynamic in the trunk and stat-\nic in the hip. In conjunction with the L-sit (static in the trunk and hip), they develop\na formidable capacity in the midline."}

This requires continual study, and one\u2019s teaching will\nimprove with greater understanding in all fields that intersect with fitness.\nAn effective teacher also has a unique ability to relate to every student, regardless\nof his or her background and ability.

An effective teacher also takes\nownership for recognizing when communication between the teacher and athlete\nbreaks down.

A trainer needs multiple strategies for each fault because\ndifferent clients often respond to the same cue in a different manner.\nWhen multiple faults occur at once, a trainer is best served by attacking them one\nat a time in order of importance (i.e., triaging). The ordering is based on the se-\nverity of the deviation from ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task; no\nsingle ordering of faults can be used across all athletes and movements.

{"148": "HOW TO DEVELOP AS A TRAINER\nTo keep up with athletes\u2019 progress, a coach must continue to refine and develop\nhis or her knowledge. If a trainer\u2019s clients are not testing the limits of his or her\nknowledge, the trainer is not doing a good enough job with them. An expert coach\nis eager and proud to have a student exceed his or her abilities but seeks to delay\nit by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the athlete\u2019s\ngrowth. Coaches should focus on development in both academic and practical\nenvironments.\nHere are some suggestions for how trainers can develop:\n1) First and foremost, teach to learn. It is only through experience that\na trainer will learn and gain competency. It is imperative to work with\npeople in a dynamic environment, even if they are friends or family\nin the beginning. Understanding biochemistry, anatomy and teaching\nmethodologies is important and supportive of this endeavor, but it is not\nenough to allow a trainer to apply knowledge in real time.\n2) Watch more experienced coaches\u2014regardless of their specific discipline.\nWatch what they watch and when they watch for it. Listen to their cues.\nThe best coaches often need very few words to produce noticeable\nimprovement in mechanics. Also watch their rapport with clients. What\ndraws clients to them?\n3) Film yourself coaching others. This can also help with your ability to see\nand correct movement faults as you have the luxury of slowing down the\nfootage. Be critical of yourself and use the six criteria detailed above to\nassess strengths and areas for improvement.\n4) Attend a Level 2 Certificate Course (L2). The L2 allows trainers to work\non their coaching (specifically seeing and correcting movement) in the\npresence of their peers. Where the Level 1 Course is important for\nunderstanding the conceptual framework of CrossFit, the goal of the"}

The archives (since 2001) contain years\nof original CrossFit programming. It is a great resource for learning\nand experimenting with workouts. We challenge all trainers to follow\nCrossFit.com programming for at least six months to understand well-\nvaried and challenging CrossFit programming.

The demands of teaching and class management often take the\nattention away from seeing and correcting movement. New trainers are encour-\naged to coach friends and family in individual or small group sessions (two or\nthree athletes) to perfect their ability to improve mechanics before taking on large\ngroup classes.

Rhabdo-\nmyolysis (often simply referred to as \u201crhabdo\u201d) is a medical condition that might\narise from breakdown of muscle tissue and release of the muscle cells\u2019 contents\ninto the bloodstream. This process can damage the kidneys and can lead to renal\nfailure or death in rare cases. Rhabdo is diagnosed when a patient with an appro-\npriate history has an elevated level of creatine kinase, also known as CK or CPK.\nCPK is easier to measure in the blood than myoglobin and is generally used as a\nmarker for rhabdo, even though it is the myoglobin that does the damage.\nTreatment consists of generous amounts of intravenous (IV) fluids to dilute and\nflush the myoglobin through the kidneys. In the worst cases, patients might need\ndialysis while the kidneys recover. Death, though rare, can result when kidney fail-\nure causes imbalances in the usual electrolytes, which can cause cardiac arrhyth-\nmias. Most patients make a complete recovery after being rehydrated with IV fluids\nover anywhere from several hours to a week or so, depending on the severity.\nThere are a few ways a CrossFit trainer can protect athletes from rhabdomyolysis:\n\u2022 Follow the charter of mechanics, consistency, intensity.\n\u2022 Know the movements that have a higher rate of rhabdomyolysis incidence\n(those that prolong the eccentric contraction), and be mindful of the total"}

If there are no\nseparate classes for beginners, treat the workouts as technique sessions for new-\ner athletes\u2013focus on their mechanics rather than speed or load. There is no set\nprotocol for how quickly to increase intensity, but it is wise to err on the side of\ncaution and work toward long-term fitness. Multiple months at scaled loads and\nvolumes are well within a normal timeframe for even the best athletes, with gradu-\nal increases in intensity implemented after that. Trainers need to frequently check\nin with athletes to determine how the previous dose of exercise affected them.\nAlthough intensity is a significant part of CrossFit, each athlete has his or her entire\nlife to continue to improve fitness and tolerance for intensity.\nThe second way to mitigate the risk of rhabdomyolysis is to know the movements\nassociated with a higher rate of incidence. Beginner athletes should keep \u201cnega-\ntives\u201d (movements which prolong the eccentric phase) to a minimum. Although\nnegatives can be an effective way to increase strength, they should not be used\nin high volumes with beginners. Athletes may increase the volume of negatives\ngradually over time.\nWhile the eccentric phase of movements cannot and should not be avoided, there\nare movements in which people are more likely to prolong the eccentric phase. In\nCrossFit, these tend to be jumping pull-ups and full-range-of-motion glute-ham de-\nveloper (GHD) sit-ups. In the jumping pull-up, the athlete should not prolong the\ndescent but should instead immediately drop to an extended-arm position once\nthe chin has cleared the bar, absorbing the impact with the legs. Similarly, in the\nfull-range-of-motion GHD sit-up, newer athletes should use fewer repetitions and\npotentially a shortened range of motion until capacity is developed. It is also prudent\nfor trainers to scale the number of repetitions and the range of motion for athletes\nwho do not routinely use GHD sit-ups regardless of their CrossFit experience.

The discoloration of the urine comes from the muscle\u2019s myoglobin, which is\nthe same molecule that gives red meat its color. If these symptoms appear follow-\ning a workout (or at any time with regard to dark-red urine), the athlete should seek\nmedical attention immediately.\nThe athletes at highest risk seem to be those with a reasonable baseline level of\nfitness obtained through some non-CrossFit training, those who are returning to\nCrossFit after a layoff, or even experienced CrossFit athletes who reach volume\nor intensity significantly outside their established \u201cnorm.\u201d These athletes have\nsufficient muscle mass and conditioning to create enough intensity to hurt them-\nselves.

Each athlete needs enough space to perform the movements, with an\nadditional buffer to account for the errant-moving equipment, missed attempts,\nand safe passage of coaches or other athletes. Under no circumstances should a\ntrainer permit extra equipment like bars, plates, boxes, etc. to be left lying around\nthe workout area. This equipment might trip athletes or cause a ricochet if other\nequipment lands on it.\nIt is also imperative for a trainer to prepare for falls during dynamic movements. It is\npossible that an athlete might lose his or her grip during a kip (pull-up or muscle-up).\nTrainers might encourage athletes to wrap their thumbs around any bar in an ef-\nfort to provide additional feedback to the athlete. This is not foolproof, however,\nand can sometimes be even less secure, particularly for athletes with small hands.\nWhatever the hand position chosen, it does not replace the need for the athlete to\ndevelop body awareness of when to end the movement if his or her grip is compro-\nmised (wrapping thumbs is always recommended for barbell and ring movements\nto help provide better balance and control, especially in higher-risk scenarios such\nas a bench press or muscle-up). Boxes and racks should not be beneath, behind or\ndirectly in front of these athletes. Adjustable rings should be lowered to the appro-\npriate height. Where assistance boxes are necessary, they are best placed to the side\nof the working athlete (and not in another athlete\u2019s way) to leave a clear path should\nan athlete leave the apparatus prematurely. A suggestion for trainers trying to man-\nage these risks is to do a \u201cdry run\u201d of the workout before it begins: check the working\nspace for each athlete for each of the proposed movements. This can be as simple as\norganizing the class to rotate stations on the trainer\u2019s call and perform a quick walk-\nthrough to check spacing and arrangement.

As CrossFit workouts use relatively high intensity, ath-\nletes are working at their physical and psychological tolerances. It is possible for\nathletes to push too hard, and confounding environmental factors might exacer-\nbate certain situations.\nExtreme temperature fluctuations, especially heat, can be problematic. Trainers\nshould be ready in unseasonably hot and humid weather with sufficient water, and\nthey should watch for common signs of overexertion (e.g., dizziness). Hot weather\nalso increases the potential risk for rhabdomyolysis (although some cases have\noccurred in cold climates), and trainers should encourage athletes to stay hydrated\n(with the caveat that they should not be excessively hydrated. Current mainstream\nliterature suggests rates of 1.2 L/hour, which are actually too high and can lead to\noverhydration). In the event of a potential heat stroke following a workout (e.g.,\nathlete demonstrates an altered mental state), a trainer should remove excess\nclothing from the athlete and then douse him or her with cool water before med-\nical attention arrives.\nWeather aside, other conditions might need medical attention. Symptoms such\nas numbness or chronic pain in joints and muscles should be referred to medical\nprofessionals. Medical attention is immediately necessary for any non-respon-\nsive athlete."}

It also presents a serious risk of ex-\nercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), a potentially deadly dilution of the body\u2019s\nserum sodium concentration.

The\nmaster trainer is eager and proud to have a student exceed his abilities but seeks\nto delay it by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the\nathlete\u2019s growth.\nBecause I want my clients\u2019 training experience to transcend the physical realm,\nI am obligated to understand their jobs, hobbies, families, and goals. Motivating\nclients to transcend fitness requires that I be involved in their lives. This is not go-\ning to happen without my being both interested in them and interesting to them.\nBeing a voracious reader of books, newspapers, and magazines, I have no short-\nage of conversation, ideas, and knowledge to share, and so you will find me at my\nclients\u2019 parties, weddings, and family gatherings. Indeed, I am a personal friend to\nnearly every one of my clients. This is extremely gratifying work and often emo-\ntionally charged, but that is all right because I am an integral part of my athletes\u2019\nlives, and life is full of laughter, tears, and hope.\nOur friendship, the fun we have, and the frequency of our contact, coupled with\nthe scope of fitness\u2019s impact and the technical merits of my training, contribute to"}

More than just the\nbackbone of CrossFit\u2019s strength and successes, it has been, we believe, the prima-\nry reason for our success.\nUsing this template, we built a practice that kept us both busy from roughly\n5 to 10 a.m. Monday through Saturday. That schedule produced a low-six-figure in-\ncome, which is really amazing given that we got to work together, with our friends,\nhaving a positive impact on people\u2019s lives, and keep afternoons free for family,\nrecreation, and study.\nTraining with the attention and commitment that we bring to our practice, though\nfun and immensely rewarding, is also draining, and five appointments per day is\nabout all we could handle without an unacceptable drop in energy, focus, and,\nconsequently, professional standards.\nEventually, the demand for our training exceeded the time we were professionally\nable or willing to allot. In an effort to accommodate more athletes, we began to\nhold group classes.\nWe had used group classes to train some of our athletic teams, and everyone\nloved them, trainers and athletes alike. The social dynamic of group classes is ex-\ntremely powerful. Run correctly, they motivate an athletic output that is only rarely\nmatched in one-on-one training. The competition and camaraderie of the group\nclasses motivated our line \u201cmen will die for points\u201d and the recognition that Cross-\nFit is \u201cthe sport of fitness.\u201d\nGroup classes also dramatically increase training revenues!"}

The trainers who are running group\nclasses without growing into them are typically not working to the professional\ntraining standards that we have described. They also seem to have an inordinate\ndifficulty filling their classes.\nThis is exactly how we built our group classes. After working for years at the limit\nof our one-on-one capacity, we started accepting new clients by doubling them up\nwith other one-on-one clients to form one-on-two appointments.\nWe introduced the shift to group classes by telling the existing one-on-one clients\nthat we had good news for them: \u201cYour training rate is going to go down and we\u2019re\ngoing to introduce you to a new friend.\u201d Where there was resistance to sharing the\ntime we asked for a trial period.

Attention, en-\nthusiasm, voice projection, and engagement all have to escalate. It is an acquired\nskill\u2013an art, really. Our goal is to give so much attention and \u201cin your face\u201d presence\nto each participant that each is actually grateful that he did not get more attention.\nThe essential shift is that the level of scrutiny and criticism is ratcheted up along\nwith the rate of praise and input for each client.

The efficiency\nand effectiveness of this paradigm is breathtaking.\nWe have used the pursuit of excellence to guide our every move. For instance,\nwhen we were considering the last expansion of CrossFit Santa Cruz we could not\ndetermine whether it would be financially feasible or not. The variables were too\nnumerous and the assumptions too uncertain to convince any accountant of the\nwisdom of expansion, but when we asked the simple question, \u201cWill it improve\nthe quality of the programming and the training experience?\u201d the answer was a\nresounding \u201cYes!\u201d On expansion, the CrossFit Santa Cruz numbers tripled within\nsix months and the extra space allowed for some refinements and additions to our\nprogramming that would not have been possible otherwise.\nAs our seminars, journal, website, and affiliate program grew, we handed off the\ngroup classes to a new generation of CrossFit trainers who now cover most of the\noverhead costs of CrossFit Santa Cruz.
