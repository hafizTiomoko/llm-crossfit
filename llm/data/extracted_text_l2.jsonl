Effectiveness can be assessed by asking whether clients optimize\nwork capacity across broad time and modal domains (i.e., whether a client becomes as fit and healthy as possible)\nA newer trainer may have only rudimentary capacity in each area and clients still will see results because of the\ninherent benefits of performing constantly varied functional movements at high intensity. An effective trainer, on\nthe other hand, has the ability to safeguard health and improve performance for a client beyond what he or she\ncould do alone.\nAlthough these areas can be described and defined independently (below), there is a natural overlap among them in\na real-time coaching environment. A deficiency in any one area can inhibit a trainer\u2019s success. Even a weakness in one\narea relative to the others blunts the trainer\u2019s overall reach. For example, a trainer with tremendous knowledge and\ntechnical skill (teaching, seeing, and correcting) will still have difficulty retaining members if there is little persona\nconnection with them (presence and attitude).\nRegardless of a trainer\u2019s current level of proficiency, a commitment to improving each area is the hallmark of a\nsuccessful trainer. Similar to the athlete\u2019s path to refining and improving movement mechanics, a trainer must refine\ncoaching skills across a career to become great. Doing so develops virtuosity in coaching.\nTEACHING\nThe ability to effectively articulate and instruct the mechanics of each movement, including the ability to focus on major\npoints of performance before more subtle or nuanced ones. It also includes the ability to change instruction based on\nthe athlete\u2019s needs and capacity.\nTo teach functional movements, a trainer must first understand what defines proper mechanics and what may cause\npoor movement. A trainer must know ideal positions, but more frequently a trainer\u2019s job is to teach athletes how to\nimprove poor positions and movement patterns.\nKnowledge in fitness-related areas\nBeyond movement mechanics, trainers can also instruct clients in other areas that may improve their fitness.

The more athletically advanced the athlete, the greater the depth of\nknowledge needed for a trainer to produce additional fitness gains. Continued research, education, and practical\nexperience over the course of a career develop a breadth of knowledge applicable to any athlete, from beginner to elite.\nTeaching demands not only possessing knowledge but also the ability to impart it to others. Knowledge alone does\nnot make one an effective teacher. Successful teaching hinges on a trainer\u2019s ability to accurately convey as much of\nthat knowledge as possible to others.\nEffective communication\nTo convey knowledge effectively, a teacher must be able to change his or her communication style to meet the\ncapacity of the student, regardless of his or her background, ability, and learning style. This is why trainers are\nbest served by using different means of communication\u2014visual and verbal teaching, for example\u2014to aid learning.\nImplicit in the trainer-athlete dialogue is the trainer taking responsibility for when communication with the athlete\nbreaks down. It is the trainer\u2019s responsibility to guide and lead the athlete, and it is the athlete\u2019s responsibility to be\ncommitted to the process. However, if the athlete is clearly frustrated with the instruction, the trainer must change\nstrategies or communication style until the athlete succeeds.\nA trainer can also assess the effectiveness of teaching and communication by determining whether the athlete meets\nperformance expectations. If no one in a group moves to the level the trainer expects, he or she needs to reevaluate\nthe instruction. It is often not the athlete\u2019s fault. A good teacher can use effective communication to prevent a large\npercentage of problems from occurring. For example, it is often effective to break complex movements down into\na progression or logical teaching steps that allow the athlete to practice pieces that naturally build on one another.\nA teacher who shows an athlete a barbell clean, describes it in its entirety, and then asks the class to replicate it can\nexpect few (if any) to match the instruction. Conversely, using a progression\u2014such as that demonstrated for the\nmedicine-ball clean at the Level 1 Course\u2014will get more athletes to demonstrate the gross mechanics quickly. These\nprogressions can often help a trainer focus on seeing certain faults as well.\nTeaching as much as is necessary often means the teacher must reduce and simplify his or her body of knowledge\nto the one or two most salient points at that moment for that particular athlete. With fast-paced human movement,\nchange is often hampered by long and detailed explanations when simple, broad-brush instructions are more digest-\nible. This does not mean a trainer\u2019s knowledge of the system should be simple; it is the explanation that should be.\nA trainer can ask himself or herself, \u201cWhat is the one thing this athlete needs right now?\u201d The answer will change as\nprogress is made.\nseeing\nThe ability to distinguish good from poor movement mechanics and identify both gross and subtle faults whether the\nathlete is in motion or static.\nA trainer who can effectively assess the mechanical positions as sound or unsound throughout movement has\ncapacity in seeing. Seeing is the necessary first step for a trainer to bring about change in a client\u2019s mechanics, but it\nrests on one\u2019s teaching capacity (knowledge). Trainers must first know positions of best mechanical leverage, as well\nas the effect of varying anthropometrics on these positions. If a trainer does not know what to look for, he or she will\nnot see correctible issues."}
{"17": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nStatic faults\nThe trainer must also use visual-recognition skills throughout the repetition, whether the athlete is static or dynamic\nStatic positions are the points at which the athlete is not moving, even briefly. Static positions usually occur near\nthe end ranges of motion\u2014either in the starting, receiving, or finishing positions\u2014or when there is a brief pause or\ndecreased speed, often due to a change of direction. Static positions include the setup position for a deadlift or the\nbottom of a squat, for example. Correctly identifying faults is easier in static positions because these positions give\ntrainers more time for assessment.\nDynamic faults\nDynamic positions find the athlete moving between the static positions, often at high speed. Examples of faults\nseen in dynamic movements include not reaching full hip extension in the drive phase of a clean, pressing early in a\npush press, or initiating the squat with the knees. These dynamic faults are more difficult to identify because of the\ndecreased time for assessment. The trainer must also know when and where to see faults during the movement. For\nexample, a trainer needs to see that the athlete has the weight on the heels during the drive phase of a push jerk\nbut the trainer is also evaluating the trunk-to-femur relationship for hip extension, the bar path relative to the fronta\nplane, and a whole host of other relationships. Generally, a profile view of the athlete (offset by about 45 degrees)\nis the most useful view to assess the athlete\u2019s mechanics, but trainers should not be limited to using this view only.\nThe difficulty in seeing dynamic faults increases as:\n1. the athlete moves more quickly, and\n2. the faults become more subtle.\nYears of experience help a trainer effectively coach any level of athlete. New trainers may use a few methods to\ndevelop their ability to see faults, particularly dynamic faults. One method is to study film. Slow the movement down\nto a series of static frames. A trainer may choose to film his or her own athletes or simply watch footage available\non the internet. Replaying the footage in real time after observing the movement in a static series can help bridge\nthe gap between seeing static and dynamic positions. Another strategy for newer trainers is to methodically survey\nathletes for only one fault at a time. For example, when teaching athletes the push jerk, the trainer may choose to\nwatch only for hip extension during the first several repetitions. Then, the trainer may choose to watch and see if\nthe athletes drive through their heels. Over time, trainers can observe multiple faults simultaneously (e.g., lack of hip\nextension or not having the weight on the heels), but initially, trying to see everything often results in seeing nothing\nSimilarly, newer trainers generally find more success by watching one athlete at a time per repetition instead of\nscanning multiple athletes with every repetition.\nCorreCTing\nThe ability to facilitate better mechanics for an athlete using visual, verbal, and/or tactile cues. This includes the ability\nto triage (prioritize) faults in order of importance, which requires an understanding of how multiple faults are related.\nThe ability of a trainer to facilitate improved mechanics is dependent on capacities in teaching and seeing. Teaching\nreflects a trainer\u2019s knowledge of proper mechanics; seeing reflects a trainer\u2019s ability to discern these positions in rea\ntime. If capacity is limited in either, it follows that the trainer\u2019s capacity in correcting will also be weak.\nCorrecting mechanics results in both increased performance gains and decreased risk of injury. A trainer can expect\nto correct an athlete\u2019s mechanics forever; mechanics can be infinitely refined to create ever more efficient positions"}
{"18": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nas the athlete progresses. CrossFit trainers should strive for excellent mechanics in their clients and avoid settling for\n\u201cOK\u201d movement. This means a trainer must be able to correct both gross and subtle deviations in all levels of athletes\nThey must set a high standard for good movement and be relentless in the constant pursuit of improvement.\nCorrecting hinges on the trainer\u2019s ability to:\n1. use successful cues,\n2. know multiple corrections for each fault,\n3. triage faulty movement, and\n4. balance critique with praise.\nCues\nAny cue that results in improved movement mechanics is successful and therefore a good cue. There are no specific\nformulas, formats, or rules to follow for cues, and their value is based on the result. A cue\u2019s primary function is to\nhelp the athlete execute perfect mechanics, not to perfectly describe the mechanics of the movement. For example\none may say \u201cweight in heels\u201d to help a person shift weight back and better achieve pressure across the foot (versus\non the toes). Generally, making cues short, specific, and actionable tends to result in a greater success rate. Short\nspecific, and actionable cues are useful because the trainer gives a single task for the athlete to complete. An example\nof this type of cue is, \u201cPush your knees out.\u201d It is short (four words), specific to a body part (knees), and also indicates\naction and/or direction (out). It is easy for the athlete to respond to a cue such as this, even when performing a com-\nplicated movement.\nIt is possible for a trainer to confuse cueing with fault identification. For example, pointing out the fault that is pres-\nent\u2014\u201cYour knees are caving in\u201d\u2014does not tell the athlete how to fix it. An experienced athlete may be able to make\nthe leap from hearing the identification of the fault to then fixing it, but this translation from fault identification to\nspecific direction is ultimately the trainer\u2019s responsibility.\nTrainers may also rely on more technical language in their cues (i.e., \u201cYou are losing your midline\u201d), which assumes the\nathlete has a significant amount of fitness-related knowledge. While such language may give the appearance of being\nmore technical (and perhaps represents an attempt to sound more intelligent), it is at best a vague verbal cue. Cues\nshould be kept to simple language that is easily understood by anyone. Non-specific language is also best avoided\nin cues. Something such as, \u201cGet tight!\u201d or \u201cChest!\u201d can be meaningless to the athlete, especially in the absence of\ninstruction on how to \u201cget tight\u201d or where and how to move the chest.\nA basic three-step process for developing short, specific, and actionable cues is:\n1. identify the fault,\n2. identify what is out of place (be specific: name the body part), and\n3. give direction to that body part.\nAs stated before, \u201cPush your knees out\u201d is a short, specific, and actionable cue.\nHowever, even with short, specific, and actionable cues, there is no guarantee the athlete\u2019s movement will improve\nThe trainer needs to use multiple cues until the fault is resolved. There are cases in which a cue that is effective for\none athlete is ineffective for another, and in other cases, even a good cue may result in poor movement. \u201cGet your"}

Nevertheless, some athletes interpret this cue to mean that the weight should be on their heels exclusively\nand they fall backwards or lose their balance. That does not mean the cue was bad or the trainer was wrong; it means\nthe trainer has to try an alternative cue.\nA trainer should not be limited to a certain set of cues for a specific fault, and he or she should continue to use differ-\nent cues until the movement improves. Over time, a trainer develops corrective strategies, building a bank of options\nfor every fault. These corrective strategies should include verbal (i.e., speaking), visual (i.e., showing), and tactile\n(i.e., touching) cues, all of which may be employed to fix the same fault but may be interpreted differently among\nathletes. Verbal cues tell the athlete a specific instruction, visual cues create contrasting images between current and\npreferred positioning, and tactile cues use physical targets to achieve proper mechanics. The greater the number of\nstrategies a trainer can employ for any fault, the more likely it is that he or she will be successful in correcting the fault\nTriaging faults\nDetermining which single fault to correct can be a challenge, as multiple faults often occur together. Ideally, every\nfault would be addressed simultaneously, but this is unrealistic in practice. The trainer is best served by triaging\nfaults. The term \u201ctriaging\u201d is most often used in medicine to assign urgency to those needing medical attention\nTriaging when coaching movement means assigning urgency to the multiple faults present in order of the most to\nleast important. Greater importance is assigned to faults that have the highest risk for injury (and, therefore, also the\ngreatest potential to limit performance). In a loaded environment, there are many cases in which the fault to address\nfirst would be loss of a neutral spine, usually in flexion. However, a flexed lumbar curve at depth in an air squat is less\nconcerning than that same position in a loaded back squat. This athlete needs to continue to air squat to full depth\nfighting for a neutral midline, all while maintaining the range of motion required by life. It is precisely the practice of\nthe movement, even with less-than-ideal mechanics, that will eventually allow him or her to reclaim positions that\ncan be loaded. In this example, completing the full range of motion was given more priority than midline stabilization\nThe ordering is based on the severity of the deviation from the ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task\nthere is no single ordering of faults that can be used across all athletes in all applications.\nWhichever fault the trainer decides to fix first should become the trainer\u2019s focus. He or she has to selectively ignore\nthe other faults present. Once that fault is fixed or mitigated at least to the degree that it is no longer the most import-\nant, the trainer can move on to the next issue.\nAfter choosing which fault to address, the trainer needs to know how the various faults are related. A trainer may\ncue a different body part than the one he or she is trying to fix due to the interrelatedness of movement mechanics\nSuppose an athlete performs an air squat with the following faults: weight shifting forward, knees collapsing, and\nback rounding. The trainer needs to consider: Are the caving knees causing the back to round? Is the rounded back\ncausing the weight to shift forward? Perhaps the trainer chooses to address the back position first but actually tells\nthe athlete, \u201cPush the knees out.\u201d There are cases in which allowing more room for the pelvis helps create a neutra\nspine position.\nAssess the cue\u2019s effectiveness and provide feedback\nAfter a trainer delivers a cue, he or she must stay with that athlete for at least another repetition to assess the result\nWhatever the athlete\u2019s response, the trainer needs to provide feedback. A trainer needs to let the athlete know if\nthe movement was the same, better, or worse. If the movement improves, a trainer needs to acknowledge that"}
{"20": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nperhaps with, \u201cThat\u2019s better\u201d or, \u201cGood correction.\u201d This helps the athlete develop kinesthetic awareness of proper\npositioning. In some cases, an athlete may improve movement but not to the desired degree. Encouraging these\nathletes simply to give more in that same direction is often a sound strategy (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s better, but even lower!\u201d). If\nthe movement has not changed, this could be addressed simply by saying, \u201cNot there yet\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019ll come back to you,\u201d\nfor example. An unsuccessful cue should not be repeated multiple times with a single athlete; instead, the trainer\nshould find a new cue. If the movement changes for the worse, the trainer also needs to immediately recognize this\nand stop or reverse it (e.g., \u201cOther way\u201d).\nNot staying to assess the effectiveness of a cue and provide the athlete with feedback is almost the same as not\ngiving a cue at all. If a trainer tells an athlete to do something and walks away before seeing the result, he or she may\nmiss it when a cue results in no change or even change for the worse. The athlete has no idea if his or her efforts\nhave resulted in improvement. All feedback, positive and negative, is tied to the athlete developing better kinesthetic\nawareness. Precision of word choice is critical. The use of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d needs to be reserved for actual sound or\nimproved mechanics and not used as a filler.\nThroughout the cueing process, a trainer must also be aware when praise for hard work (regardless of change) is\nnecessary. There are cases where no change or only a very slight change occurs in a session. Celebrating the effort\nacknowledges the hard work put forth that day and helps a client remain willing to continue to work hard. A trainer\njust needs to be clear when the praise is for the effort rather than a movement that still needs improvement.\ngrouP ManageMenT\nThe ability to organize and manage, both at a micro level (within each class) and at the macro level (the gym as a\nwhole). This includes managing time well; organizing the space, equipment, and participants for optimal flow and\nexperience; planning ahead; etc.\nGroup management is not just about organizing logistical considerations for a class so clients have enough space\ntime, and equipment to complete the workout. It is about optimally managing these variables to support the best\npossible instruction (see \u201cComponents of an Effective Class\u201d). Poor planning of any aspect of a class\u2014for example\nthe amount of time spent on certain parts, how the equipment is set up, and how much time is allotted to each par-\nticipant\u2014can detract from the quality of the experience.\nAdhere to the schedule\nAt its most basic level, effective group management means adhering to posted schedules. Clients plan their sched-\nules around these announced times, and it should not be assumed that they have more time or flexibility. Adhering\nto posted times means both starting and ending on time: Running over is as unacceptable as starting late. Ending\nlate usually occurs when a trainer does not plan ahead and think through the entire class schedule. Adhering to the\nschedule also includes the schedule within each class. Following a simple template (such as introduction, warm-up\nworkout, and post-workout) every class helps ensure necessary time is devoted to each piece (see \u201cComponents of\nan Effective Class\u201d). The trainer may also consider the experience level of the class to determine which pieces need\nmore time or less time during instruction.\nSpace and equipment layout\nGroup management also includes variables such as space layout and equipment availability. The layout needs to\naccount for buffer zones around any equipment in use and should also take into account when athletes have to move"}
{"21": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nto different areas of the gym during the workout. The class size often dictates which workouts are realistic given the\nequipment and space. Even in cases in which neither is limited, an effective trainer should have pre-determined alter-\nnatives for any class workout should a larger number of participants show up unexpectedly.\nGroup management speaks to the trainer\u2019s ability to reduce the logistical setup and preparation time during a class to\nmaximize the amount of teaching and movement time. This means the trainer plans ahead and perhaps prearranges\na complicated workout with multiple pieces of equipment and/or weights. Spending several or more minutes sorting\nequipment takes away from a trainer\u2019s time to instruct, improve, and refine movement.\nPlan how and what to teach\nTime spent on instruction can also reduce the client\u2019s practice time. A trainer needs to plan how and what to teach to\nmaximize the client\u2019s time moving. Allowing for enough practice time every class is necessary for both the trainer and\nclient. Less practice time gives the trainer less time to observe and cue movement mechanics, as well as less time for\na client to work on movement with improved form. Change in mechanics comes from continual cueing across many\nrepetitions.\nDuring every class, the trainer also needs to manage the attention given to each participant. Every student should\nfeel that he or she received enough attention. While some clients need more time than others, even good movers\nwith subtle inefficiencies need to be coached, pushed for higher speed and/or loads, or praised for sound perfor-\nmance. Attention still benefits them. To assist with each client getting enough individual attention, a helpful tool is\nto keep the group on the trainer\u2019s cadence for all repetitions during the warm-up or skill work. Controlling when the\ngroup moves ensures the same number of repetitions are completed by everyone. It also allows the trainer to sys-\ntematically and selectively observe individuals and specific aspects of their movement.\nThe size of the class affects how much time a trainer can spend with each person, but the class size should not be\nbeyond the trainer\u2019s capacity. The demands of large classes often turn trainers into crowd herders, timekeepers and\ncheerleaders who have little time to spend on cueing individual movement faults. Newer trainers (those with less\nthan two years of experience) can rarely find success when stepping into classes of 10-plus participants. In his article\n\u201cScaling Professional Training,\u201d CrossFit Founder Greg Glassman explained that after years of one-on-one persona\ntraining produced groups of two, eventually groups of three, and so on, his classes continued to grow until growth\nresulted in \u201cperceived reduction in attention\u201d to each paying member.\nRegardless of experience, trainers should make an honest assessment of the time and attention given to each client\nafter each training session. Did he or she make an assessment of each athlete\u2019s weaknesses? Did he or she make rea\nmovement change that session? If the answer to either question is no, the session was likely too large for the trainer\nThe goal is to maximize a trainer\u2019s effectiveness and reach.\nPresenCe and aTTiTude\nThe ability to create a positive and engaging learning environment, showing empathy for athletes and creating rapport\n\u201cPresence and attitude\u201d refers to the trainer\u2019s ability to create a positive atmosphere and develop a rapport with each\nclient.

{"22": "Foundations of Effective Training, continued\nKnow your clients\nAn effective trainer recognizes that each person has different abilities, insecurities, needs, and goals; he or she also\nhas the awareness and interpersonal skills to respond accordingly. The trainer recognizes that individuals respond\ndifferently to instruction and critique and makes it his or her responsibility to determine how best to relate to and\nmotivate each individual regardless of background and ability.\nA trainer must be aware of whether each client is interested in each class; a client\u2019s needs may change with the days\nand external life demands. The trainer should know what is happening with most of the group most of the time, and\nthis goes beyond movement mechanics. This includes issues such as who is struggling that day due to external pres-\nsures or stress, who has high energy, who is aloof or annoyed, who is new to the gym, etc. All these factors may affect\nthe degree to which the athletes can perform relative to their usual capacity. Effective trainers know these things\nbecause they routinely interact with their clients and are invested in their relationships with them.\nA common trait of trainers with a positive presence and attitude is that they genuinely care about their clients\u2019 success\nThis care means more to clients than the trainer\u2019s knowledge. Many clients have little interest in the technical aspects\nof training. Their interests often lie in unrelated professions and hobbies, and they are at the gym to improve the\nquality of their lives. The mechanisms of their success in the gym are much less important to them than the results\nand success itself. In addition to seeing results, clients know if they feel welcomed and cared for, respected, inspired\nand motivated. They can sense whether the trainer has their best interests at heart.\nBe authentic\nA positive presence and attitude cannot be faked; it comes from a sincere passion for service. It can take on many\nforms based on the trainer\u2019s personality and interpersonal skills. Trainers should not interpret this as being any single\ntrait, such as loud, funny, or bubbly. Trainers are encouraged to be authentic. There is room for any personality type\nto succeed if a trainer couples genuine caring with awareness of his or her limitations and recognizes the effect he\nor she may have on clients. This may motivate a trainer to become a better version of himself or herself. A trainer\nmay set personal goals to compensate for any perceived shortcomings. For example, a trainer who is perceived as\nreserved may make an effort to be at class early to welcome and greet each member.\nNewer trainers especially may be shy or nervous in front of a group, and this may blunt their presence and attitude\nSmall mechanical changes, such as eye contact, open body language, and smiling, can go a long way toward putting\nthe trainer\u2019s best foot forward. Trainers might try asking clients simple questions about well-being and then really\nlistening and following up about their answers.

This requires a trainer to adjust demonstrations depend-\ning on the group and its needs. Just like teaching, demonstration may have to be made more simple and obvious\nthan realistic and subtle to meet the needs of the trainees. In cases in which a trainer\u2019s mechanics are limited, using\nothers for demonstration is perfectly acceptable. Trainers who have the capacity to discern good movement patterns\nquickly do not have a problem finding an effective substitute.\nDemonstrate credibility\nDemonstration also covers whether a trainer demonstrates to others that he or she ascribes to the program that is\nrecommended and holds himself or herself to the same standards and values expected of clients. Demonstration\nmore broadly speaks to the trainer\u2019s credibility. Leading by example has a large influence on the culture created at\nthe trainer\u2019s gym.

{"26": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nCOMMON MOVEMENT THEMES FOR FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS\ninTroduCTion\nThere are common movement themes displayed in all foundational movements, from the nine foundational move-\nments in the Level 1 Course to others such as the snatch, kipping pull-up, and handstand push-up. These movement\nthemes broadly categorize similar positions and movement patterns, whether the athlete is static (starting, receiving\nor finishing positions) or dynamic (moving between static positions).\nThese themes are:\n\u2022 midline stabilization,\n\u2022 core-to-extremity movement,\n\u2022 balance about the frontal plane,\n\u2022 posterior-chain engagement,\n\u2022 sound hip function,\n\u2022 active shoulders,\n\u2022 full range of motion about a joint, and\n\u2022 effective stance and/or grip.\nUnderstanding these themes and the contexts in which to apply them will give trainers the general principles for eval-\nuating movement. There are positions or movement patterns that do not fit neatly into these categories, as well as\nmovements that do not demonstrate all the themes. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. It is simply a classification\ntool that can be used to aid development of one\u2019s coaching skill set.\nThese themes are exemplified when an athlete performs a movement correctly (i.e., adhering to the points of per-\nformance). The movement themes increase the potential for improved performance and minimize the risk of injury\nSound mechanics aid performance and risk management by using positions with the best mechanical and muscular\nalignment, conferring safety, efficacy, and efficiency simultaneously.\nMidLine sTabiLiZaTion\nA \u201cmidline\u201d is a plane of bilateral symmetry, but it is used in CrossFit to specifically refer to the relationship of the\nspine (base of the head to the top of the hips) and pelvis during functional movement. The midline trisects the spine\nand bisects the pelvis when the two are in their neutral anatomical relationship. Stabilization means something has\nbeen made stable, or \u201cstatic.\u201d Midline stabilization refers to the athlete\u2019s capacity to prevent movement from this\nneutral spinal position and is synonymous with core strength. Midline stabilization determines whether the athlete\ncan maintain the natural S-curve of the spine to the pelvis when dynamic and/or loaded. Some lifting applications\nrely on a midline posture with some extension past neutral in both the lumbar and thoracic regions. Regardless, this\nposture is maintained throughout the movement.\nStabilization of the spine is largely accomplished by engaging the abdominals (\u201cabs\u201d), internal and external oblique\nmuscles (\u201cobliques\u201d), and erector spinae (\u201cspinal erectors\u201d or simply \u201cerectors\u201d). Engaging the abs helps engage the\nspinal erectors and obliques; together, they create a belt of musculature around the vertebrae."}
{"27": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nTorso as a rigid, integrated structure\nThis neutral, static position maximizes performance because moving the torso as one rigid, integrated structure\nenables the transmission of force between the appendages and the object being lifted. In a push jerk, for example\nthe legs and hips extend force upward into the weight through the torso. A soft midline does not allow for the optima\ntransfer of force to the bar.\nWhen maintaining a neutral spine, the orientation of the vertebrae results in favorable distribution of forces and\nreduces the risk for injury. Where possible, it is ideal to have the midline in a vertical orientation because of the optima\nmuscular and skeletal alignment for force distribution (e.g., in a squat). As the torso moves from a vertical orientation\nas in the deadlift, the demand on the musculature to maintain a neutral spine increases. Forward movement of the\ntorso, however, does not increase the risk of injury if midline stabilization is present. It is when midline stabilization\nis lost that the shear force experienced by the spine increases. The human spine is more susceptible to injury when\nexposed to shear (vs. compression) forces. The resulting shear force attempts to push one vertebra past another\nwhile muscles and ligaments resist this loss of positioning. If the muscles and ligaments are not strong enough, an\ninjury to the spine may occur.\nDeviations from neutral\nDeviations from neutral may occur in flexion (bending forward from neutral) or extension (bending backward from\nneutral). Recall that a natural function of the abdominals is to flex the spine, so spinal flexion by itself is not nec-\nessarily problematic (e.g., getting out of bed) and is potentially beneficial to reduce the lever arm (e.g., gymnastics\nholds). Similarly, the erectors extend the spine. Extending past neutral is not inherently dangerous but can become\nso depending on degree of deviation and the load on the body.\nThe following hierarchy of spinal positioning is listed in order of increasing risk for injury:\n\u2022 Safest: Midline stabilization in a neutral position.\n\u2022 More risky: A non-neutral spine in a static position. Although less ideal than midline stabilization in\na neutral position, static positions (flexed or extended) prevent movement of the individual spinal\nsegments. This means no individual vertebra bears the majority of the lifting force.\n\u2022 Most risky: Loss of a neutral spine during movement, specifically when starting from neutral and moving\nto significant spinal flexion. This is potentially the most injurious, as there is movement of the individual\nspinal segments and one or a few vertebra(e) bear the majority of the lifting force.\nThe most common injury from a loss of midline stabilization occurs when the lumbar spine (L1\u2013L5) flexes under\nload, changing the normal concave curvature of the lower back to convex. Typically, flexion of the spine is seen with\nincreased hip flexion or when the midline is resisting a load on the front side of the body, as in a deadlift.\nAthletes may also deviate from neutral by overextending or hyperextending the spine, which means significantly\nbending backward from neutral into an injurious range of motion. There is a difference between the natural S-curva-\nture of the spine and an exaggerated extension of the spine. Placing athletes in an overextended position does not\nincrease the benefits of a neutral spine and may place them at risk for injury.\nHyperextension can result in the same injuries as excessive flexion (i.e., disc herniation or damage to facet joints)\nHyperextension generally occurs with more flexible athletes or occasionally with more advanced athletes. Over-"}
{"28": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nextension or hyperextension often points to a lack of engagement of the abdominals and can generally be addressed\nby cueing an athlete to tighten the abs. It is most often seen when an athlete lifts overhead.\nCORE-TO-EXTREMITY MOVEMENT\nCore-to-extremity movements demonstrate a sequence of muscular contraction that begins with the large force-pro-\nducing, low-velocity muscles of the core (abdominals and spinal erectors) and hips, and ends with the small force-pro-\nducing, high-velocity muscles of the extremities (e.g., biceps, calves, wrist flexors). Core-to-extremity movement\nbegins with establishing midline stabilization for effective force transfer\u2014i.e., a base is created and force radiates\nfrom there. This muscular patterning teaches the athlete to fluidly transmit power from one area of the body to\nanother. Core-to-extremity movement maximizes performance because it tasks the largest musculature to generate\nforce first, allowing the greatest forces to develop. This sequence improves efficiency and allows the greatest amount\nof work to be accomplished.\nCore-to-extremity movements are less risky than movements that violate this pattern because the largest muscles\nare tasked with generating the most force. Smaller muscle groups and associated tendons and ligaments are more\nsusceptible to injury, such as tearing, when exposed to loading designed for larger movers.\nCore-to-extremity movements are found everywhere, not just with movements that involve the arms and legs, so\nfaults can show up everywhere. Even a shoulder press or a deadlift may not effectively demonstrate core-to-extrem-\nity movement absent a stable midline. For dynamic faults, core-to-extremity violations occur when there is incorrect\ntiming and the arms move before the hips and legs have extended (i.e., pulling or pushing early).\nBALANCE ABOUT THE FRONTAL PLANE\nThe frontal plane divides the athlete into anterior and posterior halves. It is the plane about which one is balanced\nand it bisects the athlete at mid-foot. Referencing the athlete\u2019s movement (i.e., his or her line of action) and the object\nhe or she is moving relative to the frontal plane can often determine the athlete\u2019s efficiency.\nSignificant deviations of the athlete and/or object forward of the frontal plane prevent successful task completion\nespecially as the loading increases. These deviations can also impair other points of performance (i.e., neutral spine\nweight on the heels). Generally, moving an object along straight lines (i.e., in the frontal plane) can increase perfor-\nmance by increasing efficiency as the object follows the shortest distance between two points. Note, however, the\nathlete\u2019s movement accommodates the object and may or may not be characterized by straight lines. For example\nin a movement such as the squat, an effective line of action is created when the hips sit back and down as the knees\nbend. In this manner, the athlete is best able to keep the weight on the heels, and when the squat is loaded, the bar\ntravels along the shortest line. This movement also can reduce excessive force at the patella, which may occur if the\nknees translate excessively forward (i.e., such that the heels come up).\nBalance about the frontal plane can also be referenced in a kipping pull-up, where the plane is formed along the\nline from the hands to the floor. The athlete is most efficient when the center of mass oscillates about this plane to\nmaintain the most efficient timing of the swing. In the kipping pull-up, when the center of mass deviates from the\nfrontal plane too much, the athlete loses timing and has to reset the swing.\nA lack of balance about the frontal plane may increase the risk for injury because of increased potential for other\nmovement errors. For example, if the chest drops in a front squat with the bar deviating forward of the fronta"}

However, a violation of balance about the frontal plane by itself is not\nterribly risky.\nPOSTERIOR-CHAIN ENGAGEMENT\nThe posterior chain includes the group of muscles, tendons, and ligaments on the posterior (back) of the body, which\ncontains the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), gluteal muscles (\u201cglutes\u201d), and spina\nerectors. \u201cEngagement\u201d means this musculature contributes to the movement. Posterior-chain engagement does not\nrefer to using the posterior chain in an attempt to exclude the anterior chain. Ideally, there is a balance of pressure\nbetween the balls of the feet and the heels, with the line of action at the frontal plane. Posterior-chain engagement\nalso enables the athlete to maintain optimal knee alignment with the foot.\nInclusion of this large set of musculature on the backside of the body maximizes performance because of the\nincreased power generation, thereby resulting in faster speed to completion or increased load lifted. Keeping the\nheels rooted brings the load closer to the frontal plane, which helps the athlete stay balanced and drive the load up\nnot forward. This increases efficiency. Engagement of the spinal erectors is also essential for maintaining midline\nstabilization and providing the strongest base to transmit forces.\nFinally, engagement of the posterior chain helps keep the knees in line with the toes, where there is the best mechan-\nical position of leverage between the upper and lower leg. With posterior-chain engagement, greater musculature is\nrecruited to move the load, and enough room is created for full range of motion in a squatting movement. When the\nknees collapse inward, the center of pressure shifts forward (given the angle at which the knees flex). This positioning\nis often a result of underdeveloped external rotators of the hip.\nPosterior-chain engagement contributes to safety because it promotes midline stabilization and balance about the\nfrontal plane. Also, keeping the knees in line with the toes reduces lateral and rotational forces at the knee joint\nThese forces are problematic for a hinge joint such as the knee, where associated tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and\nmenisci could be damaged when poor mechanics are allowed to go unchanged over long periods of time. It is less\nlikely that a single repetition causes significant damage to the joints, but thousands of repetitions performed over\ntime can wear on the knees\u2019 structural integrity.\nPressure in the feet\nA lack of posterior-chain engagement results in the athlete (and/or object) shifting excessively forward of the fronta\nplane. A trainer can see this by observing the center of pressure in the feet in all movements, especially with any knee\nor hip flexion. This may or may not occur in conjunction with the heel coming off the floor. The heel can remain on the\nground while the center of pressure shifts forward.\nThis may also indicate premature shifting of weight to the toes, especially during an explosive hip extension, which\nresults in the hip extending forward rather than upward. If an athlete jumps forward during a lift, it may be an indica-\ntion of a premature shift of weight to the toes. \u201cTriple extension\u201d is not a forced calf raise in conjunction with exten-\nsion of the knees and hips; it is achieved when the heels leave the ground because of, and after, a violent extension\nthereby creating extension of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Analysis of elite lifters shows that the longer a lifter\nremains in contact with the ground during the second pull, the greater the acceleration on the bar. Greater surface\narea in contact with the ground enables a greater force to be transferred."}
{"30": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nKnee position\nWith regard to knee position, although there are two directions the knees can travel to come out of alignment with\nthe feet (laterally or medially), the fault is usually seen when the knees collapse inward (medially). The degree of devi-\nation in knee alignment generally increases with increased hip and knee flexion in a movement and/or wider stances\nAn athlete with a poor knee position in any movement often produces the error to some degree any time the knee\nflexes. For example, an athlete whose knees collapse in a squat is likely to have the knees collapse to a less obvious\ndegree in running, box jumps, push presses, etc.\nSOUND HIP FUNCTION\nSound hip function refers to the athlete\u2019s ability to flex and extend the hip to maximize its contribution to a move-\nment. The hamstrings and glutes are powerful hip extensors. Powerful and complete hip extension is necessary for\nelite athletic capacity because:\n1. it applies the most force on the object, and\n2. it creates the most elevation on the object, giving the athlete the most time to accommodate or receive it.\nThere are no major safety issues with slow or incomplete hip extension.\nPoor hip function is usually expressed in one of three ways:\n1. muted hip,\n2. lack of hip extension, and/or\n3. slow hip extension.\nA muted hip never closes/flexes (and therefore is a \u201cpermanently\u201d open hip). If the hip never closes, the movement is\npredominantly driven by the quadriceps. The quadriceps extend the knee without contribution from the hamstrings\nand glutes. Lack of hip extension does not allow the power of the hamstrings and glutes to be fully expressed. This\ndoes not effectively put acceleration on the bar or object and therefore does not elevate it to any significant degree\nEven small deviations from full hip extension result in reduced power transmission. The speed of hip extension\nplays a critical role in accelerating the object being lifted, particularly when the object must be elevated far beyond\nits starting point (e.g., from rack to overhead). In all cases, the power of the musculature of the hips is not opti-\nmally expressed.\nACTIVE SHOULDERS\nAn active shoulder provides the most stable position for the shoulder when working against a load. This means an\nactive shoulder is present in the overhead lifts as well as the deadlift series, including the deadlift, sumo deadlift high\npull, and medicine-ball clean. Outside the nine foundational movements, active shoulders are found in the kipping\npull-up, ring dip, handstand push-up, row, and snatch, among other movements.\nActive shoulders are about scapular position and stabilization and require different actions by the athlete, depend-\ning on the movement. In each movement, the athlete attempts to keep the shoulder in a relatively neutral, natura\nposition, without yielding to a load. At the same time, he or she will create enough space between the anatomica\nstructures of the shoulder so they may pass freely without impingement. Typically, this means an athlete demon-\nstrates an active shoulder by applying force in the direction opposite the load. For example, in an overhead squat, the\nathlete pushes up on the barbell. In a push-up, the athlete pushes down into the ground. In a row, the athlete pulls"}
{"31": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nback to prevent the rounding of the shoulders. There are also cases in which an active shoulder is not achieved by\npushing into the load (e.g., bench press). In all cases, the retraction, elevation, etc. is not taken to the end range that\nresults in a contrived position. For example, retraction in a deadlift is not full retraction that may result in a loss of\nmidline stabilization or a position that would not be possible under any real load.\nAn active shoulder creates optimal skeletal alignment, which enables the most musculature of the torso (e.g., tra-\npezius) to aid in the stability of the shoulder and potentiate the greatest force. An active shoulder also moves the\nacromion process out of the way of the humerus, reducing the chance for impingement of the biceps tendons and\nrotator-cuff muscles. The chances for impingement increase as the grip narrows. In an overhead squat, for example\na wider grip requires less elevation to create clearance space.\nWhen an athlete loses an active shoulder, the direction the shoulders move (e.g., forward, down) depends on the\nmovement. The coach needs to observe from where the force is being applied and determine if the shoulders are\nmoving in that same direction (e.g., yielding).\nfuLL range of MoTion abouT a JoinT\nFull range of motion about a joint describes the natural anatomical beginning and end positions of a movement. Ful\nrange of motion allows a greater complement of musculature to be used (e.g., reaching full depth in a squat, using\nactive shoulders) and in some cases better mechanical advantage (e.g., bar resting on the body in the front rack)\nJoint safety is maximized by preserving the range of motion required by life while best distributing forces at any one\njoint or throughout a series of joints. Additionally, increasing the musculature and joints involved allows the athlete\nto develop the neuromuscular coordination that is universally found in compound movements and sport.\nToward the other extreme, hyperextension or artificially trying to create more range of motion past a joint\u2019s natura\nanatomical function can be detrimental to joint health; more is not always better.\nTraining to the full range of motion in functional movements best prepares an individual for any conceivable task\nWhile life\u2019s tasks may not always require full range of motion, training to the limits of one\u2019s natural end range prevents\ndeficiencies if and when the joints need to move the full range. Using full range of motion preserves joint health, flex-\nibility, and strength, reducing the chance of injury and decrepitude later in life. If there is not a more pressing safety\nissue that needs to be fixed first, a trainer needs to preserve full range of motion above much else (e.g., adding load\nincreasing speed).\neffeCTive sTanCe and/or griP\nThis refers to the foot and hand positions adopted during a movement, where the optimal stance and grip promote\ntask accomplishment and the ability to display all the movement\u2019s points of performance.\nThere are two common stances in CrossFit. A narrower stance (hip width) is used in the deadlifts, presses, and the\nOlympic lifts. The hip-width stance promotes a more direct transfer of force through the heels/floor and into the\nobject being moved. A wider stance (shoulder width) is used in squatting movements, allowing for greater depth\nand contribution of the posterior chain. Some force-transfer efficiency may be lost with the wider stance (relative to\nhip width), but function and range of motion are gained. It is possible to take a different stance to allow for different\nloading mechanics. For example, a wider stance is adopted in the sumo deadlift. This allows the torso to remain more\nupright, allowing the legs and hips to more readily assist the back during the lift."}
{"32": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nThe grip is usually outside the shoulders or hips so as not to interfere with the object or other points of performance\nbut it may also be wider if the demands of the movement require it. For example, the grip in the deadlift should\nbe wide enough so as not to interfere with the legs, but it is significantly wider in the snatch to reduce the overal\ndistance the bar must travel.\nIn many real-life applications with odd objects, a wider stance or narrower grip may be used. It is critical for athletes\nto learn how to apply the other points of performance, regardless of the stance and grip used to accommodate an\nobject. This is especially true of preparing an athlete for situations outside the gym, when a more convenient stance\nand grip are not always possible.\nThere are no major safety concerns from a lack of effective stance or grip except when other points of performance\nare adversely affected. The value of any stance and grip adjustment should be assessed based upon its effect on al\nthe other points of performance in the movement.\nASSESSING SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE\nSimply observing an athlete\u2019s position in a movement does not provide enough of a context to assess safety risk and\nperformance benefit. Both are assessed in light of the individual\u2019s:\n1. athletic capacity,\n2. loading,\n3. positioning, and\n4. speed of execution.\nA trainer cannot identify bad positions without this greater context. Decreased performance and increased injury are\nmore likely as the athlete moves further from a sound position or as loads increase relative to the athlete\u2019s maximum\nFor example, picking up a grocery bag with a rounded back is a common occurrence and contains little safety risk\nfor many CrossFit athletes. Nevertheless, this same positioning could be more problematic for a beginner deadlifting\n135 lb. or an advanced competitive athlete deadlifting 500 lb.\nIn daily training, athletes are encouraged to exercise using the correct positions to develop strength and awareness\nUsing sound mechanics promotes greater potential for power development and decreases injury risk in the long\nterm. Training in the best positions, regardless of the load present, develops a sound default motor pattern that\nbetter prepares athletes for loaded and high-intensity scenarios.\nBecause of the benefits to safety, efficacy, and efficiency, proper mechanics are a daily focus of CrossFit trainers\nWorking toward better movement is not only for beginners and is arguably more important as the athlete advances\nThe margin for error decreases as load and speed increase. Top competitors rely on efficiencies that can create\nseconds of gain. A trainer cannot settle for anything less than excellent mechanics. For example, an immature squat\nmay be a safe position, but if the athlete can learn to lift the chest, every degree of elevation can increase the loads\nthat can be lifted in a clean or snatch, for example. A trainer must challenge himself or herself to develop better\nathletes beyond their current capacity."}
{"33": "Common Movement Themes for Functional Movements, continued\nConCLusion\nThese themes provide a template from which a trainer can evaluate all movement in order to maximize both safety\nand performance for his or her athletes. The ability to recognize and correct violations is essential for a trainer\nregardless of whether the athlete\u2019s violation is major or minor.\nUnderstanding these themes provides a template for evaluating other approaches to coaching a movement. These\nthemes also can help a coach think critically about any methods before including them in instruction: If there is not\na clearly demonstrable mechanism that creates a safer or more effective movement, it is usually an unnecessary\ndistraction.\nFor example, suppose a coach considers a new starting posture for the snatch or clean. He or she wants to use a\ndynamic start such that the athlete moves through the setup without a pause before the first pull. If the athlete\nis able to achieve the common themes (e.g., midline stabilization, posterior-chain engagement, balance about the\nfrontal plane) in a static start and there is no clear performance gain from a dynamic start (i.e., increased loads lifted)\nit becomes an unnecessary layer of complexity to add to the mechanics of the lift.

{"36": "Heavy Days, continued\nHEAVY DAYS\nThere is the tendency for new CrossFit athletes and trainers to avoid heavy days entirely or execute them incorrectly.\nHowever, CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program. While people sometimes characterize CrossFit by its pro-\ngramming of mixed-modal workouts for time (\u201cmet-cons\u201d), this is a limited view. Days devoted to strength training\nare essential to CrossFit and are integral to CrossFit\u2019s prescription of constantly varied workouts.\nHeavy days are necessary to build top-end strength and power. Power output decreases with time, meaning that an\nathlete\u2019s work capacity in very short time domains sets the theoretical limit for his or her entire curve (Figure 1). It is\npossible to have high levels of short-duration power and little power elsewhere (e.g., a powerlifter), but it is impossi-\nble to have low levels of short-duration power and higher levels of longer-duration power. Therefore, heavy days are\nessential to a general physical preparedness program and should be used at least once a week or once every two\ncycles (where a cycle is three on, one off).\nfigure 1. Generalized work-capacity curve.\nHeavy days are not the only time athletes drive strength adaptations. Even within a metabolic-conditioning workout,\ndepending on the task and the capacity of the athlete, any number of exercises may build strength. Push-ups for\nnovices build pressing strength similar to a bench press, and attempting a 95-lb. thruster for a new CrossFit athlete\nbuilds squatting strength. As an athlete\u2019s strength increases, push-ups and 95-lb. thrusters tend to favor other adap-\ntations such as stamina, and greater loads are necessary to further increase top-end power.\nHeavy days can be completed with most any weightlifting or gymnastics movement, such as weighted dips and\npull-ups and lifting odd objects (e.g., sandbags, axles). More often than not, however, a barbell is best because it is\nimpossible to match the barbell\u2019s ease and range of loading with other equipment. Heavy days may also include all\nvariations of standard barbell movements (e.g., hang, power, from a deficit, pulling from pins/bumpers)."}
{"37": "Heavy Days, continued\nRepetition schemes\nThe heavy-day workout consists of small sets, most often in the range of 1 to 5 repetitions, where the total volume of\nworking repetitions is approximately 7 to 25. Repetitions significantly outside this range do not produce the desired\nresponse. If there are too few repetitions (e.g., one repetition of a near-maximum load), the athlete does not produce\nenough stress on the taxed muscles to drive a new adaptation. Conversely, too many repetitions (e.g., 30 or more\nrepetitions of near-maximum load) produces too much stress for the athlete to recover from in a reasonable time\nperiod. The working sets generally occur at or above 80\u201385 percent of a 1-repetition-maximum load, and warm-up\nsets used to get to this loading do not count toward the total working repetitions. This is not an exact percentage\nbut a working set should be heavy enough to require concentrated effort. The working sets also do not produce a\nsignificant cardiorespiratory response.\nRepetition schemes may vary. As a general guideline, the higher the repetitions in a set or across the entire session\nthe lower the loading. This tends to better develop muscular stamina and/or technique. The lower the repetitions\nthe higher the loading. This tends to better develop top-end strength. Both approaches should be used. Repetition\npatterns include standard schemes such as 7 x 1, 5 x 3, 5 x 5 (sets x reps); pyramid-like patterns of 1-2-3-2-1 (reps\nper set); descending/ascending schemes such as 5-4-3-2-1 (reps per set); no set specificity (e.g., work up to a max\npush press); and on-the-minute training (1, 2, or 3 repetitions on the minute, every minute for 10 minutes), among\nothers. Failed attempts count toward working sets. However, the goal of a session should be to complete the majority\nof the lifts.\nHeavy days are for everyone: the young, old, fit, and unfit. Using the concept of relative intensity, a trainer has each\nathlete lift a load that is relatively heavy for him or her. Even beginners should participate, although a trainer should\nbe more cautious progressing a new athlete in load. Trainers can potentially give beginners more repetitions (either\nwithin each set or by increasing the total number of sets) to very gradually progress to a reasonably challenging\nworking weight while instilling appropriate mechanics. Relatively new athletes often set a personal record every time\nthey lift heavy. As the lifter becomes more experienced, sessions without a new personal record may occur. Setting\na personal record is not necessary to reap the benefits of lifting heavy.\nMinimizing risk\nAs risk increases with load, the trainer has several safety concerns to manage when leading a strength session. A\nheavy-day class best begins with a thorough warm-up to prepare the athletes for maximal loading (e.g., increase\ncore temperature and improve range of motion). It also provides the trainer with an opportunity to correct and\nrefine mechanics across warm-up sets of the movement to minimize risk. Finding the best way to complete warm-up\nsets usually becomes an intuitive process as athletes become more experienced with lifting heavy. However, most\nathletes in their first few years still need direction through this section. Common practice for warm-up sets is at\nleast 3 to 5 warm-up sets, where the sets start with a lighter weight/higher repetition count and progress to heavier\nweight/lower repetition count. The rest periods in the warm-up sets do not need to be as long as during the working\nsets. Whatever the warm-up is, trainers cannot fatigue the athlete for the work sets. Instead, warm-up sets gradually\nprime the body for heavier loading while refining the mechanics of the lift.\nThe trainer must also teach each athlete how to bail and/or spot as necessary before any significant weight is\nattempted. It is easiest to have participants practice this with a PVC or dowel. A trainer cannot assume athletes\nwill perform bailing or spotting techniques correctly without specific instructions. The gym floor also needs to be"}
{"38": "Heavy Days, continued\narranged to ensure safe, walkable distance between working athletes, and the floor should be absent of extra equip-\nment. Trainers may choose to have participants share racks, in part to reduce equipment and space needs. Sharing\nracks also allows athletes to help one another with loading, unloading, and spotting. It also allows for adequate\nrest time between sets so athletes fully recover. When using racks, additional instructions are needed to ensure\nthat athletes keep enough distance between themselves and the racks when lifting. The trainer needs to clearly\ndescribe how the working sets should be approached to avoid confusion. For example, the workout may be 5 x 5\nfront squats. Does the trainer want the athletes to try to increase the load with every set? Does the trainer want the\nathletes to hold a certain percentage across all sets? Or does the trainer perhaps want the athletes to find a new\n5-repetition maximum, meaning the exact number of working sets is less important (maybe it takes 4 sets, maybe\n5 sets)? All these approaches have validity and potential benefits, but the trainer needs to indicate what the intent is\non a particular day.\nDuring the working sets, the trainer must appropriately apply the principles of threshold training just as he or she\nwould in any other workout. Once an athlete\u2019s mechanics significantly deviate from the points of performance, the\nload needs to be reduced. This is especially true when multiple verbal and visual cues do not result in any improve-\nment in mechanics. It is possible that the trainer can fix the mechanics at lighter loads and then allow the athlete to\nagain increase the load gradually. Deviations from points of performance may also require the trainer to change the\nmovement for a few repetitions before using the entire movement (e.g., using snatch pulls to correct an athlete who\nis pulling early in the full snatch). Once the workout is complete, the trainer should include equipment clean-up and\nworkout logging as part of the cool-down period.\nCueing during a heavy lifting session needs to be very direct. The athlete\u2019s attention will be almost solely focused\non the effort required to complete the lift. The trainer will have little time or opportunity to impact the quality of the\nmovement during the set. Therefore, cues need to be short, easy to implement, and delivered with an intensity that\nmatches the effort of the lift. If more technical consideration is needed, the time between sets can be a great oppor-\ntunity to elaborate. However, upon returning to the next set, the athlete should have a very clear picture of what he or\nshe needs to focus on. Giving your athlete more than one or two things to think about often results in no change at all\nConCLusion\nTrainers need to regularly program strength days with their clients and ensure all participants achieve the desired\nstimulus during the training session. These sessions provide coaches and athletes with opportunities to improve\nmechanics, acquire new skills, and see progress in a modality that is vital to developing the fitness CrossFit seeks."}

During the Level 1\nnutrition lecture, participants were walked through the importance of eating quality foods, and there was discussion\nof a few common ways to quantify food intake. Eating meats, vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and\nno sugar in combination with weighing and measuring macronutrient quantities can have a profound effect on one\u2019s\nhealth and performance outcomes.\nA tsunami of chronic disease has been sweeping across the world, and CrossFit affiliates are the lifeboats. Each gym\nhas within its walls the necessary ingredients to make profound changes to one\u2019s health.\nAs a coach, knowing what to eat, how to eat, and why it is important is only half the battle. The real struggle is in\nimplementing dietary changes and trying to create a high level of compliance.\nPerhaps one of the most important aspects of behavior change is one\u2019s belief that he or she is capable of making a\nspecific change. This is considered one\u2019s self-efficacy.\nIt is very important for coaches to know they have everything they need in the gym to increase an athlete\u2019s self-effi-\ncacy. Coaches should feel equipped to set up the perfect intervention to get athletes eating better for long periods\nof time, if not indefinitely.\nIt is up to the coach to help increase athletes\u2019 self-efficacy and encourage them to believe that changes are possible.\nIncreases in self-efficacy are a result of:\n\u2022 Mastery experiences: These are small achievable steps throughout the process. Success in these steps will\nincrease self-belief (i.e., adding vegetables to each meal).\n\u2022 A coach\u2019s ability to adjust to different emotional and physiological states: A coach must adjust to how others\nperceive change and deal with stress (i.e., be sensitive to the fact that Rebecca has always eaten this way,\nand she has three young children to consider).\n\u2022 Vicarious experiences: Coaches should use the successes of others to convince athletes that they, too, can\nbe successful (i.e., Joe started by cutting out low-quality food for a month. Then he would quantify only his\nbreakfast. Eventually, he measured his lunch, and six months later, he has lost 40 lb.).\n\u2022 Verbal/social persuasion: Athletes should receive verbal support from others, including from role models\n(the trainer) and/or in small groups (i.e., create an accountability buddy, send reminders, videos, articles\ncontaining any material that motivates the individual to stay the course).\nThese are four factors that affect self-efficacy (Bandura). These factors should be sought in combination with each\nother for best results.\nWhen thinking about behavior change within the context of a gym environment, we can understand the stages of\nchange as contemplation, action, and maintenance. These three stages apply most accurately to the gym environ-\nment and the relationship between coach and athlete."}

Does the\nathlete believe in his or her ability to change eating habits and to eat the optimal ratios and amounts?\nConTeMPLaTion\nA coach must first educate. Teaching the art of nutrition is no different than teaching functional movements. It stil\nrequires an in-depth knowledge of the material:\n\u2022 What are quality foods? What are unhealthy foods? How do you replace the unhealthy foods with healthier\nchoices?\n\u2022 How do you quantify macronutrients, and what tools are needed to weigh and measure?\n\u2022 Why is changing your diet important, and what are the expected outcomes?\n\u2022 What skills do you need to make this change and maintain it?\nCoaches then need to find the best way to communicate this information to their athletes. The explanation must be\nsimple, actionable, and realistic. This starts the process of building the skill set and producing the incentives required\nto make meaningful changes to diet.\nSuccessful gyms have accomplished this in a number of ways.\n\u2022 Small Nutrition Talks\n{ These talks are often provided during introductory sessions.\n{ Each small talk builds on the one prior. Athletes continue to develop knowledge and enhance skills\nin small steps (mastery experiences).\n{ Typically, food logs are used to determine necessary changes.

The assumption\nthat building a shopping list is easy is one of the reasons many do not succeed. The coach\nmust guide this process.\n\u2022 Large Nutrition Lectures\n{ Typically, these are lectures that cover everything from eating quality foods to using different ways\nto weigh and measure food.\n{ The information is provided all at once to a large group of athletes, typically with a question and\nanswer session at the end.\n{ These tend to be used as an introduction to nutrition challenges.\n\u0083 The main points might be covered again in a small group format during the challenge.\nIt is important to understand that how someone perceives the journey will also have a profound impact on the results\nPerception is reality.

{"51": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nPROGRAM DESIGN AND SCALING\nCrossFit is defined as \u201cconstantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity,\u201d with the goal to develop\nfitness that prepares one optimally for any task imaginable. The programming material of the Level 1 Course outlines\nworkout variables and basic considerations for structuring workouts. The programming material at this course builds\non that foundation by focusing on long-term program design for individuals and groups.\nAmong the myriad variables to control when programming workouts, a trainer cannot lose sight of the small influ-\nence programming has among a host of other factors that determine a client\u2019s success. Programming, whether\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d is secondary to effective coaching, appropriate scaling, using sound mechanics, and developing a\ngroup dynamic conducive to pushing oneself (i.e., highest intensity brought to the work). Even with less-than-optimal\nprogramming, a trainer who has a good eye for movement mechanics and develops a good rapport with his or her\nclients will help people improve their fitness for years. Functional movements performed at high intensity, regard-\nless of how well they are combined and varied, are powerful enough to elicit dramatic changes in one\u2019s health and\nperformance, particularly for the unaccustomed. Therefore, trainers can spend more time focusing on their skill set\nand member rapport rather than striving beyond reason to create the \u201cperfect\u201d template and programming cycles.\nANALYZING PROGRAMMING FOR EFFECTIVENESS\nEffective or \u201cgood\u201d programming produces results, and the relative degree to which programming is effective is the\ndegree to which it optimizes fitness. The standard by which to evaluate any programming is measurable improve-\nment in performance markers. For a CrossFit athlete, results would include increased loads on heavy days, decreased\ntimes on task-priority workouts, and increased repetitions or rounds on time-priority workouts. An optimal program\nwould see the maximum possible increases in any test of fitness.\nOther measurable markers include health markers. Faster Fran times, more rounds of Cindy, and heavier 1-repe-\ntition-maximum clean and jerks are correlated with decreases in blood pressure, triglycerides, and resting heart\nrate. Additional results may be reported by clients, such as improved quality of life, improved confidence, increased\nenergy, and mood alteration. Anecdotal improvements in quality of life are side benefits of CrossFit. While not mea-\nsurable, they are valued by many clients over the metrics of improved workout statistics and health markers.\nIneffective programming does not produce results, or at least not to the same degree possible with effective pro-\ngramming. These suboptimal results could include decreased performance on benchmark workouts, merely modest\nimprovements in performance markers, or even a higher rate of injury, which could be easily avoided by following\nother programming.\nThe key is that program effectiveness is based on results: real changes in measurable, observable, repeatable\nmarkers. Clients need to get results for the programming to be deemed effective.\nTrainers programming for a group or an entire affiliate can simply use the same measurement applied across the\nentire gym population. A trainer can look for long-term trends and patterns in the group by assessing performance\non select benchmarks. For example, a trainer may select specific benchmarks to follow: He or she may track clients\n1-repetition-maximum snatch, 1-repetition-maximum back squat, Grace, Fran, Tabata squats, 1-mile run, JT, Fight\nGone Bad, 5-km row, and Cindy as his or her fitness tests.

As long as\nthe majority of members are improving their scores on these days, the programming is effective. A trainer must\nremember that this is a long-term view, and he or she cannot expect everyone to set a personal record (PR) with every\nbenchmark test due to variables beyond his or her control, such as mood, sleep, stress, the physiology of the athlete\nand even the athlete\u2019s commitment to the program. Intermediate to advanced athletes, for example, cannot expect\nto set personal records every time they repeat a workout due to the decreased magnitude of adaptations that result\nfrom increased proficiency (i.e., the learning curve).\nvarianCe in CrossfiT PrograMMing\n\u201cVariance\u201d refers to the intended variation of functional movements, loads, repetition schemes, and time durations\nwithin a single workout and across a series of workouts in order to best maximize one\u2019s fitness. Other factors (e.g.\nenvironment, gear) can be varied but are not the primary variables to consider. The variation of workout variables\nacross months and years determines how well one is prepared for any conceivable test of fitness. A program with\na narrow focus may show great results in one area but have little impact on another. For example, a powerlifting\nprogram may see increases in strength and power for certain lifts, but it might produce worse performance in lon-\nger-duration, higher-repetition scenarios or even decreased strength and power in certain other lifts, like the snatch\nIn the name of variance, there are few absolutes for formulating the infinite combinations of workout variables. An\nerror in programming variance is only problematic when the error becomes routine. Today\u2019s workout does not have a\ndramatic impact on one\u2019s fitness; it is the series of workouts that result in long-term change. Programming too many\nheavy days in a row, for example, develops a narrow capacity. Conversely, programming a few heavy days back-to-\nback on occasion may be an entirely appropriate or beneficial stimulus.\nLong-term planning and routine assessment\nEffectively combining workout variables over the long term requires intentional and careful planning. The program-\nmer must be well versed in CrossFit methodology to understand similar and disparate stimuli, as well as which\nstimuli are the most potent. Programming requires reviewing what has been completed recently in an attempt to\nprovide new variance. It must also allow for routine assessment to ensure progress is occurring.\nTo a lesser degree, the programmer must understand each athlete\u2019s current capacity and weaknesses. For any\nlevel of athlete, a well-varied program should cover many different aspects of fitness. As an athlete becomes more\nadvanced (e.g., a CrossFit Games competitor), additional time may be needed to improve weaknesses in addition to\nregular CrossFit programming. Regardless, effective programming cannot be random. Although CrossFit program-\nming appears random to some due to its non-linear and non-formulaic pattern, its variety is a result of a planned\nattempt to address all fitness tests. This does not happen by the luck of the draw.\nCrossFit.com programming\nCrossFit.com provides a great expression of variance for general physical preparedness. An athlete who can perform\nall main-site workouts as prescribed (Rx\u2019d) has a robust fitness capacity. Across all the workouts on CrossFit.com\nsome very broad trends suggest some combinations are more useful than others to develop this level of fitness\nCrossFit more frequently programs whole-body, natural, high-power movements in short, intense workouts because\nof their far-reaching effects on one\u2019s overall fitness. These principles are generally expressed in task-priority couplets\nand triplets of 15 minutes or less, which include full-body, high-power movements utilizing complementary functions\n(e.g., pulling vs. pressing). This simple, but highly effective\u2014i.e., elegant\u2014programming drives CrossFit\u2019s potency. A"}
{"53": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nprogrammer cannot be fooled into believing the simplicity of the movements and combinations equates to \u201csimple\u201d\nresults. Complexity does not inherently produce greater efficiency or efficacy, and arguably it detracts from both.\nClassic CrossFit benchmark workouts such as Fran, Helen, Diane, Elizabeth, and Fight Gone Bad are all excellent\nexamples of these basic principles. Fran (21-15-9 repetitions of thrusters and pull-ups) is an elegant combination\ntwo full-body movements, complementary in function (lower-body push and upper-body pull) to allow intensity to\nremain high while simultaneously expressing functions necessitated by life (squatting, putting an object overhead\npulling the body up).\nCrossFit programming is best summarized in World-Class Fitness in 100 Words, by CrossFit Founder Coach Greg\nGlassman: \u201cPractice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C & J (clean and jerk), and snatch. Similarly\nmaster the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips\nsplits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc., hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many\ncombinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly\nlearn and play new sports.\u201d\nAlthough many CrossFit workouts follow these trends, not all should. Less frequently, athletes need to be exposed to\nworkouts that are more unorthodox. For example, there are times when workout variables that result in decreased\npower output are entirely beneficial for an individual. A load that may be too heavy for an athlete to move con-\ntinuously in a workout is also a stimulus for greater strength. A high-repetition scheme that causes the athlete to\nstop multiple times in a single set is a stimulus for greater stamina. Even using lower-powered movements such\nas a Turkish get-up in a workout are useful occasionally for developing greater coordination, balance, and shoulder\nstrength under cardiorespiratory stress. The bulk of workouts, however, should strive for simple, bold pairings.\noPTiMiZing CrossfiT PrograMMing\nMost every client can improve his or her fitness without individualized programming. Small adjustments in the\ncontext of regular CrossFit programming, such as weakness work and scaling workouts appropriately, can accelerate\na client\u2019s results within general group programming.\nWorking weaknesses\nA weakness is a certain skill that is lacking relative to an athlete\u2019s proficiency in other areas. By improving one\u2019s\ncapacity in these weak areas, the athlete\u2019s overall fitness increases. Effective CrossFit programming by itself is aimed\ntoward improving weaknesses. With well-varied, unbiased combinations of loads, time durations, movements\netc., clients inevitably see improvements in their fitness for years. Over the months and years, just performing the\nelements one struggles with will improve one\u2019s proficiency in these movements.\nAn athlete may choose to do additional weakness work to accelerate progress and will likely find this also improves\nstrengths. Working on weaknesses is also important for clients who have reached a plateau. Coach Glassman has\nasserted the following: \u201cThere is more traction, more advantage, more opportunity in pursuing that one thing that\nyou don\u2019t want to see come out (of the hopper) headlong than to put more time into that thing you\u2019re already good\nat. That thing that you don\u2019t want to see come out is a chink in your armor. And addressing it will make a difference\nfor you in ways that you\u2019ll never be able to predict.\u201d"}
{"54": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nIt is unlikely that the programming needs to change drastically to address weaknesses, particularly for an affiliate\nor large group setting. Further, trying to tailor the program to every individual weakness is impossible. The best the\ntrainer can do is to observe and respond to the general trends in the gym and provide well-varied programming\nconsistently.\nConstant assessment is needed to ensure that too much capacity is not lost in the strong areas. When assessment\nhas shown that the weak areas are now at an acceptable level, the trainer should look to identify the next area\nof weakness and make small adjustments accordingly. A radical change in programming is likely to eliminate the\nbenefits experienced elsewhere (e.g., programming becomes too skewed toward the new goal).\nIf the programming becomes too skewed toward working on specific elements, then it is biased. Biasing is program-\nming certain elements more frequently regardless of current capacity in those areas. Biasing does not necessarily\nresult in an increase in fitness; it results in an increase in a specific capacity. Biasing is not necessarily negative if it\nserves the athlete\u2019s preference or goal. It is only a problem when the athlete is seeking general fitness and continues\nto follow a biased program. Addressing weaknesses may eventually become a bias in the absence of assessment.\nWeakness work can be easily included in the warm-up of the class, focusing on the technique of one of the more chal-\nlenging movements. This gives clients extra practice time to improve a deficiency and potentially allows for a more\n\u201cpersonalized\u201d program. During warm-up and skill sessions, which are often heavily biased toward newer and less\nproficient athletes, an effective trainer needs to also offer challenging options for the advanced athletes.\nFor example, suppose a trainer led a warm-up that included a skill session on pistols. Although most of the athletes\nmay be working on getting their first pistol, perhaps using a band or squatting to a box with a support, advanced\nathletes may be working on weighted pistols (e.g., with a bar in the overhead-squat position). There are examples of\nhow to use warm-ups to implement weakness work in the \u201cExample Warm-ups to Address Weaknesses\u201d section of\nthis training guide. With well-varied workouts, much of the warm-up can coincide with movement preparation for the\nworkout to practice elements that are usually weak (e.g., handstand push-ups, muscle-ups, double-unders).\nRegardless of the movements selected, trainers should be sure to avoid pre-fatiguing the client. The goal of the\nwarm-up is not to make it another workout. An example of a poor choice of warm-up may be doing three rounds of\n15 pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, and hip extensions before the workout Cindy (as many repetitions as possible\nin 20 minutes of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats). Pre-fatigue is of particular concern when a trainer plans\na longer skill session before the workout, such as handstand push-up skill work before the workout Diane (21-15-9\nrepetitions of deadlifts and handstand push-ups). Such skill work can be done, but the trainer must monitor the\nvolume such that the athletes are not unduly fatigued. Each athlete has variable tolerance to pre-workout volume\nrelative to that athlete\u2019s capacity. The tolerance builds over time, so the warm-up can eventually be more extensive\nwithout pre-fatiguing muscles.\nTemplates can be used for weakness work. They can help keep a coach or athlete committed to dedicating time to\nskill development. However, it is important for coaches and athletes to use their judgment to change or break from\nthe template as necessary.\nScaling effectively\nScaling workouts appropriately for one\u2019s clients is an essential consideration to best increase their fitness. This is not"}
{"55": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\njust a concept for beginner clients; an effective trainer progresses the most athletes toward completing workouts as\nprescribed across months and years.\nTo scale effectively, a trainer needs to review the original workout for its intended stimulus, including:\n\u2022 movement functions,\n\u2022 loading parameters,\n\u2022 time frame, and\n\u2022 volume of repetitions.\nThis does not have to be a formal process, but it helps identify appropriate scaling options.\nSuppose an affiliate decided to post the workout Amanda (9-7-5 repetitions of muscle-ups and 135-lb. snatches) for\nits daily classes. This is a workout most members at most affiliates have to scale. The basic analysis of the workout\nvariables shows:\n1. a high-skill gymnastics movement that is an upper-body pull and push and a high-skill weightlifting\nmovement that is predominantly a lower-body pull and squat,\n2. the intended loading is moderate,\n3. the intended time is short (approximately 5 minutes), and\n4. the volume is low.\nThe goal for scaling this workout is to adhere to as many of these variables as possible in light of the individual\u2019s\ncapacity. The resulting scaled workout still needs to provide each client with a significant challenge. There is no single\nstrategy that works in every situation. Scaling is also a \u201cmoving target\u201d as individual capacities change over time.\nThere are some populations for which a trainer can employ common scaling strategies:\n1. beginners and/or deconditioned individuals,\n2. intermediate athletes,\n3. advanced athletes, and\n4. injured athletes.\nScaling guidelines, and examples for the workout Amanda, are detailed below.\nBeginners and/or deconditioned individuals are generally those athletes who have been doing CrossFit for six months\nor less. For beginner and/or deconditioned individuals, a trainer needs to be primarily concerned with adherence to\nthe proper points of performance of the movements throughout the full range of motion. Increasing the difficulty\n(via movements or volume) and/or pushing for greater intensity (via speed or load) are secondary to developing\nmovement proficiency and new skill development. This group may often include the elderly, where additional safety\nconcerns may be necessary (e.g., keeping feet on the floor). Beginners need a lot of guidance: The trainer must be\nproactive about approaching them and modifying the workout.\nLoads, distances, and repetitions are the primary variables to modify during scaling, particularly before changing the\nmovement. If a movement is beyond the athlete\u2019s current abilities, a substitution should create a similar movement\nfunction and range of motion. In some cases, preserving function and range of motion can be done by using severa\nmovements to achieve a similar effect. Also, it is not \u201cstandard\u201d to increase the volume of the substituted or \u201cless"}
{"56": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nchallenging\u201d movement. For example, it is not necessary to always make those substituting single-unders for dou-\nble-unders complete two or three times the repetitions. This group often needs reduced volume, even with a substi-\ntuted movement.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for beginners/deconditioned individuals include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Reduce to whatever allows the athlete to best practice the movement with full range\nof motion. This may be a training bar, empty barbell, or even PVC pipe. If the athlete has to go very light\nto preserve movement mechanics, consider doubling the repetition scheme. This gives the athlete more\npractice repetitions, which is the primary concern for the inexperienced. It is also possible to reduce the\nrange of motion in a loaded scenario if the mechanics cannot otherwise be preserved. Regardless of the\nscaling choice, the workout should provide some challenge across the repetitions.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. Replace with a simple upper-body pull and push. Most likely, this will be jumping\npull-ups or ring rows, and squat-assisted dips, bench dips, or push-ups. These options are mechanically\nsimple relative to the muscle-up, so a trainer needs to pick an option that provides a challenge to the\nathlete\u2019s upper-body strength across the total repetitions.\nAlthough not an exact guideline, the term \u201cintermediate athletes\u201d generally describes those who have been doing\nCrossFit for six months to three years. An intermediate athlete is one who can perform some workouts as prescribed\nbut still struggles with more complex movements or challenging repetition schemes and loads. Scaling the repeti-\ntions on some gymnastics movements and the loads on some weightlifting movements is the main priority. A trainer\nmust be mindful that an intermediate athlete is best served by using different scaling options each time a particular\nmovement or load appears in a workout. A trainer can create several different options for intermediate athletes\nnot only to avoid boredom, but also to help them continue to develop their fitness. Varying the manner in which a\nworkout is scaled reduces the timeframe needed to acquire the desired adaptation.\nWith time, intermediate athletes should be able to adequately scale their own workouts. This comes with a better\nunderstanding of workout goals and their own strengths and weaknesses. Intermediate athletes may be incor-\nrectly neglected at times because they require less guidance than the beginner. Nevertheless, the majority of one\u2019s\nmembers will likely be intermediate athletes with a wide range of abilities. These athletes still need to be pushed to\nnew levels as appropriate.\nFor the workout Amanda, scaling options for intermediate athletes include:\n\u2022 Squat snatch load. Intermediate athletes often include individuals who should stay at the prescribed\nweight and potentially take longer to complete the workout. Although their power output may be lower\nthan if the load was scaled, keeping the load as prescribed helps develop exactly the strength and\nstamina needed to perform the workout in a more competitive time. In cases where this load would\nnot be completed in any realistic time frame (i.e., would take more than 20 minutes), reduce the load\nappropriately.\n\u2022 Muscle-up movement. The scale is best when it is specific to the weakness, and it therefore does not take\non one specific form. If they have significant upper-body capacity in pull-ups and dips, an effective scale\nwould be to work a transition drill, as that is where their capacity is lacking (i.e., working the transition\nhelps strengthen a greater range of motion at the shoulder). Conversely, an intermediate athlete who"}
{"57": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nstruggles with pull-ups and dips may be better served using those movements in the workout to develop\nthe pushing and pulling stamina and strength of the upper body. Depending on proficiency, perhaps the\nrepetitions of pull-ups and dips should be increased. If there is an athlete who has muscle-ups but is not\nconsistent with them or cannot perform a high volume, reducing the repetitions is a viable option to help\ntrain the skill in a mixed-modal environment (e.g., repetitions of 5-4-3).\nAdvanced-level athletes are those who can perform all workouts and movements as prescribed. Typically, these\nathletes either came to CrossFit after years of performing some functional movements at high intensities (e.g., col-\nlegiate gymnast) or they have been doing CrossFit consistently for years. There are times a trainer needs to scale\nthis athlete due to sickness, injury, personal problems, or a recent string of difficult/demanding workouts. Occasion-\nally suggesting a variation with lower loading and/or repetitions benefits the advanced athlete both physically and/\nor mentally.\nThere may be an occasion to \u201cscale up\u201d an individual if the athlete is not challenged by the repetition scheme or weight\nor is in need of a different stimulus for skill development. The obvious options are to increase load or repetitions\nchoose different equipment (dumbbells vs. barbells), or make a movement more difficult (parallette vs. regular hand-\nstand push-ups). A trainer needs to be wary of this practice and should avoid consistently making workouts heavier\nand higher in volume to provide a \u201cchallenge.\u201d More often than not, the advanced athlete needs to be coached to\nbetter movement mechanics and/or greater intensity before making a workout \u201charder.\u201d An effective trainer needs to\nfocus on fixing movement inefficiencies and pushing for faster speeds before increasing the weights and repetitions\nThese corrections translate to seconds of gain in performance.\nCoaches need to be sure not to confuse advanced for elite, where elite is reserved for individuals actually going to the\nGames. Competitive programming is outside the scope of this course, as well as outside the scope of most affiliate\nneeds. At a minimum, athletes should be considered advanced before more volume is needed.\nSome potential scaling options for an advanced athlete in Amanda are listed below. There are infinite ways to tweak\nthe workout based on needs and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the athlete. These would be good options\nparticularly when an advanced athlete already has a competitive Amanda time.\n\u2022 Snatch.

These individuals should be encouraged to par-\nticipate in the workout, as there is benefit to training even in their reduced capacity. There is a positive hormona\nresponse from exercise, which can affect a multitude of factors, from body weight to recovery to mental state\nAlthough the nature of injury determines what is possible, the goal is still the same: to replicate all workout variables\nas closely as possible.\nPain-free range of motion is the main guideline. Where the movement cannot be performed exactly, a trainer should\nfind a substitute that best replicates the basic function and/or range of motion. However, any movement that stil\nrelies primarily on the injured joint/body part should be used cautiously, if at all. A trainer may need to get creative at\ntimes to help athletes avoid boredom and keep an injured athlete working for new skill acquisition."}
{"58": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nSingle-limb work can be utilized: Contrary to the belief that this results in a problematic muscular imbalance, exer-\ncising the non-injured side can reduce atrophy in the injured side. Dumbbells are a perfect tool for one-sided work\nand the number of repetitions can increase in cases where the loading is limited. However, this should not be the\nonly option for someone with an injured limb. If an exercise involves two movement functions, an athlete may stil\nbe able to perform one with both sides. For example, in a thruster, an athlete with an injured upper body might stil\nbe able to squat or front squat. If the athlete has an injured lower body, he or she might still be able to press or push\npress. If there are no reasonable options for an injured person to perform a similar movement, omit the movement\nor substitute something else. This should be the last option considered.\nUsing the workout Amanda as an example, scaling options for injured athletes would take on many different forms\ndepending on the injury. Here are a couple of examples:\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s shoulder is injured such that he or she cannot support any load with one arm.\nPotentially, the snatch becomes a heavy dumbbell snatch on the good side, or it could become a 135-lb.\nback squat; the load could even be increased to be more challenging in the 9-7-5 repetition scheme. The\nmuscle-up may become a single-arm ring row and push-up or dumbbell press.\n\u2022 Suppose the athlete\u2019s knee is injured such that he or she has limited flexion. The snatch may become a\nsnatch variation (power, muscle, hang) depending on the range of motion of the knee. The muscle-up\nwould not have to be scaled.\nWhen the injured side is cleared to be used again, the trainer must increase intensity very gradually, with a heavy\nemphasis on maintaining optimal mechanics to prevent additional injuries.\nImplementing scaling in a class environment\nAfter a trainer has analyzed the workout and knows what is likely to need scaling (especially movement substitutions)\ndirection must be given to the entire class to help each individual to the appropriate modification. While this can be\ndifficult in a busy class setting, a lot of scaling confusion can be prevented when the trainer introduces the workout\nto the class by indicating the intended stimulus or goal of the workout. Loading, repetition, time, and movement\nconsiderations can be discussed.\nPresenting several scaling options at this time can help keep the class moving. Some gyms present set scaling options\nthat keep large groups organized. This is fine, but a trainer must also recognize that the best choice for some athletes\nmay be an entirely different option. An experienced trainer should have no problem creating unique scaling options\nas necessary without taking away from class instruction and group cohesion.\nThe trainer also needs to observe clients as they increase loads and practice the movements in preparation for the\nworkout. An effective trainer can quickly see if the movement loading and repetition scheme chosen for the workout\nare appropriate by watching warm-up sets. There are times when scaling may have been assessed incorrectly and\na trainer needs to scale after the workout has begun. If an athlete is struggling too early in the workout and will not\nachieve the desired outcome, the trainer needs to adjust one or more of the workout variables mid-workout (e.g.\nload, repetitions). This is mandatory if an athlete cannot maintain safe mechanics. In these instances, it is important\nthat the trainer is firm with his or her decision. If he or she has built a good rapport with athletes, they should have\nno problem with such adjustments."}
{"59": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\nSport-specific preparation\nMany CrossFit trainers have some sport-specific athletes looking to incorporate CrossFit training into their regimen\nWhile sport-specific athletes cannot use CrossFit as a substitute for their sport-specific practice, fixing deficiencies in\ntheir general physical preparedness has immediate benefit within their sport. These carry-over benefits may not have\nobvious mechanical or metabolic explanations. For specialists at the advanced tier of their sport, there is a greater\nmargin to improve their performance by improving their general physical preparedness versus spending more time\nin sport-specific strength and conditioning training. Sport training and physiology are not so well understood that\nhighly specialized strength and conditioning routines are optimally effective, and CrossFit brings a com bination of\nadaptations that lead to improved performance.\nA CrossFit trainer needs to remember that he or she coaches CrossFit and should not attempt to mimic the sport\nwithin CrossFit workouts. A CrossFit trainer is not the athlete\u2019s swim, soccer, or tennis coach and should not attempt\nto coach beyond his or her knowledge. Doing so results in a trainer giving poor CrossFit training and poor sport-spe-\ncific training. The CrossFit trainer needs to program CrossFit for these sport-specific athletes, just as for their non-\nsport-specific clients. The sport practices and sport coaches will improve the specific skills needed on the field, in\na match, etc.\nCrossFit trainers need to be mindful of their athletes\u2019 competition seasons to be sure the volume of CrossFit is helping\nand not hurting an athlete\u2019s sport performance. CrossFit training is secondary to the sport training, particularly in\nseason. There is often a natural trade-off in volume between CrossFit and the sport training depending on the time of\nyear relative to the in-season period. This is to allow more time and energy for competition when seasonal demands\nare higher. This may not be necessary for all athletes in all sports. The general guideline is to add CrossFit volume\ncautiously while constantly assessing sport performance and being particularly cautious when an athlete is near in\ntime to an important event.\nPrograMMing ConsideraTions: CoMMon PiTfaLLs\nIf a programmer regularly assesses his or her athletes and observes the trends in data, he or she can quickly adjust\nineffective programming. Conversely, CrossFit programmers who do not regularly assess data can fall prey to\ncommon faults, some of which are described below.\n1. The first common error made by CrossFit programmers is a lack of regular assessment to determine\neffectiveness. Measurable results in performance markers are the guideposts for a programmer to\ndetermine whether the past programming was productive as well as what needs to be programmed next\nLack of assessment may occur from not repeating benchmark workouts and/or not recording results\nTrainers need to encourage members to record results to assist with this effort. Clients generally like this\nrecord of progress, particularly after months and years of hard work.\n2. Another error for CrossFit programmers occurs when variance is not applied correctly, and this is usually\nexpressed in one of three ways: randomization of workout variables, biasing certain variables, or emphasizing\nnon-essential elements. As mentioned above, optimal variance of workout variables requires intentiona\nplanning, not merely spinning the hopper and pulling out random tasks. A hopper may be used as a good\ntest of fitness (i.e., is an athlete ready for anything?), but it is not a good method to prepare for everything\nReliance on the hopper would leave to chance the broad, general, and inclusive adaptations CrossFit is"}
{"60": "Program Design and Scaling, continued\ntrying to develop. Programming via a hopper may be fun once in a while and can be used occasionally in\ncompetitions, but it is not a method by which to program for the best results.\nBiasing occurs when certain elements or combinations are repeated too often, with some elements avoided\ncompletely. There is nothing inherently bad about biasing as long as that is the intended goal. Biasing is a prob-\nlem if the goal is to develop general physical preparedness.\nAnother misapplication of variance is emphasizing non-essential elements. This appears as an endless\ncombination of workout variables, regardless of their utility or effect. For example, never repeating work-\nouts, performing lots of accessory or skill movements in actual workouts (e.g., Sots presses, single-leg work\nsport-specific drills), or focusing too much on environmental factors (e.g., working out with a gas mask or in the\nmiddle of the night) can be signs that variance is being misapplied. It can be easy for newer programmers to\nbelieve \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d programming provides a superior stimulus because of the novelty.\n3. A third common error in CrossFit programming is a lack of higher-skill development. This can occur when\ncertain movements are avoided in workouts or when warm-ups are not used to address weaknesses. A\ncurrent trend within the community is to avoid the more difficult gymnastics movements. CrossFit athletes\nare willing to tackle the technical weightlifting movements such as the snatch and clean and jerk but do not\nspend as much time developing the more technical counterparts in gymnastics, such as levers, planches\npresses to handstands, or pirouettes.\n4. CrossFit programmers may be tempted to use excessive volume. This occurs with more than one training\nsession a day (i.e., double days). In some cases, athletes may even attempt more than two sessions. This\npitfall affects those trying to emulate the volume sometimes used by CrossFit Games athletes. Games\nathletes\u2019 training is not representative of what CrossFit programming should look like. Multiple sessions a\nday are not appropriate for 99 percent of CrossFit athletes (less than one percent of those who participate\nin the Open go to the Games). Even multiple workouts in one extended \u201csession\u201d should generally be\navoided. Extra sessions and/or extra workouts may help performance in the short term but often lead to\novertraining, higher risk of injury, and burnout in the long term. Double days help Games athletes prepare\nfor high-volume competition and can help them get in more volume so they can advance certain skills\nrelative to their competitors. Generally, however, there is actually a decrease in intensity across sessions. As\nCoach Glassman said, \u201cBe impressed by intensity, not volume.\u201d If a client is looking to be competitive, very\ngradually and cautiously increase volume. For example, start with additional skill sessions (e.g., double-\nunder practice) in areas in which the athlete is not as proficient, not multiple workouts. Look at CrossFit\ncom and assess what the athlete cannot complete, then add \u201cvolume\u201d by way of working on these skills. The\nvolume should gradually increase over the long term.\n5. Another trickle-down effect from the Games is the assumption that the \u201cCrossFit standard\u201d for a movement\nis what is performed at the CrossFit Games. Standards in competition are set for ease of judging and do\nnot necessarily represent the best expression of the movement. They are used to establish the minimum\nrequirements for a repetition, and an athlete is held to those standards to ensure the range of motion is\nthe same across all competitors. Take, for example, hand-release push-ups: There is nothing better about\nthem in terms of muscular development or mechanical advantage. They are used because they are easier"}

Standards in competitions should not prevent an athlete from using (or a trainer from teaching)\nmany different movement mechanics to develop a broad athletic capacity. There are different adaptations\nto all movements, and variations at the very least improve the overall coordination of an athlete who can\naccomplish a single task in multiple ways. CrossFit encourages athletes to learn all possible techniques and\nnot a single \u201cstandard\u201d (e.g., strict, chest-to-bar, kipping, and butterfly kipping pull-ups).

{"68": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nCLASS STRUCTURE AND LESSON PLANNING\nDuring the Level 2 Course, participants are led through a mock class from start to finish. It is meant to serve as a basic\nclass template for CrossFit affiliates. Although each example class at the Level 2 course is different\u2014from instructors\nto warm-up drills to workouts\u2014universally, there are themes that represent effective coaching practices.\nBeing a trainer is not about showing up, quickly writing a last-minute workout at the whiteboard, and turning on the\nmusic. Real training is about improving each client\u2019s fitness (and by association quality of life) in small, incremental\nsteps in a motivating and positive way. Besides having the presence, attitude, and demonstration skills to develop a\npositive rapport with one\u2019s clients (see \u201cFoundations of Effective Training\u201d), a large part of improving client fitness is\nhaving a plan, both on a day-to-day and long-term basis. This section discusses the basic but necessary components\na trainer needs to run a single class.\nTo effectively manage time, trainers need to have a lesson plan. A single class can be outlined as a four-part lesson\nplan consisting of:\n\u2022 Introduction\n\u2022 Warm-Up\n\u2022 Workout\n\u2022 Post-Workout\nThe total time of the workout helps set the allotted time for the warm-up and cool-down sections. A longer workout\nmeans sacrificing time in either or both. Most affiliates run hour-long classes, and this is the length used in the Level\n2 example class.\nLogistical considerations affect an appropriate workout to select, as well as the time allotted to each component of\nthe class. Factors include gear availability, class size, gym space (for equipment and athlete layout), and the expe-\nrience level of the class. A trainer needs to consider various alternatives because additional modifications may be\nnecessary on the fly, depending on the experience level of the clients and how many show up. For example, if the\naffiliate has limited floor space, it will not take many participants to make it cramped. For safety considerations, a\ntrainer needs to ensure there are walkable areas between all moving athletes and their equipment. Dumbbells are\na phenomenal tool for athletes; they are great space savers, as well as substitutes for barbells in many scenarios.\nTrainers may also use sandbags, the outdoors, staggered heats, etc. Trainers are limited only by their knowledge\nand creativity.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction, although the shortest element of a class, is of great importance. During the introduction\n(commonly referred to as the time \u201cat the whiteboard\u201d), the coach will brief the workout, set expectations by explain-\ning the intended stimulus, offer several scaling options, and take any questions. Generally, the introduction will take\nbetween two and four minutes, depending on the complexity of the workout and the number of participants taking\nclass. Having more participants increases the likelihood of questions. The introduction should serve to clear up any\nconfusion about the workout while also reducing pre-workout anxiety."}
{"69": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nWarm-up\nThe purpose of the warm-up is to do just that: warm the body in preparation for intense activity. Warm-ups often\nconsist of two parts: a general warm-up and a specific warm-up. The main goal of a general warm-up is to stimulate\nthe body\u2019s physiological functions\u2014i.e., increase core temperature and blood flow to the muscles, prime the car-\ndiorespiratory system, increase mobility, and move joints through a full range of motion. General warm-ups usually\ninclude calisthenic-type movements or movements that involve dynamic ranges of motion.\nThe primary goals of a specific warm-up are to build, practice, and refine proper mechanics for the movements that\nwill be used in the workout, and to prepare mentally and physically for the challenge. Specific warm-ups present an\nopportunity for movement assessment and appropriate scaling. However, potentially different ranges of motion\nand/or variations may be used (e.g., power vs. squat variations, medicine balls vs. barbells) where necessary.\nMovements that are not part of the workout may also be used in the warm-up, as the warm-up element also provides\nan opportunity to improve deficiencies in any movements (i.e., practicing handstands even though handstands may\nnot be in the workout). Typically, these options are reserved for shorter, lower-skill workouts that do not require a\nsignificant amount of time to prepare for (i.e., rowing 1,000 meters for time or running a timed mile). The \u201cProgram\nDesign and Scaling\u201d article discusses how to use this time as focused weakness work.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and coach in the warm-up period. The warm-up helps athletes best prepare\nto handle the demands of the workout and improve upon deficiencies, whether they are subtle mechanical ineffi-\nciencies in more experienced athletes or larger faults in movements with which athletes have little experience. The\nwarm-up also provides the trainer with an opportunity to assess the athletic capacity of an individual relative to\nthe intended stimulus. Following the assessment/practice period, it is time for the trainer to assign scaling options\nAlthough the trainer should have some ideas before starting a class, it isn\u2019t until after actually assessing athletes\nneeds that a trainer can choose the most effective option(s). As discussed in the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article\nscaling should progress with the athletes, and they should be constantly challenged (i.e., they should not just perform\nthe same scale every time a movement, rep range, or prescribed load is outside their current capacity). Beyond\nassessment and scaling, the warm-up is also the time for the coach to mentally prepare the athletes and oversee any\nremaining workout logistics (e.g., equipment distribution, equipment layout, heats, safety checks).\nA pre-workout break is not one of the main elements of a lesson plan, but it is needed and useful for a coach. The\npre-workout break includes safety and equipment checks, room layout, workout flow, additional scaling, questions\nfrom the athletes, a bathroom opportunity, and of course, the workout re-brief.\nThe workout re-brief is there to remind the athletes what the workout is (order of movements, repetition scheme\nand rounds or time) and the range-of-motion standards that are required. A coach needs to clearly demonstrate and\nemphasize the range of motion and mechanics for every movement before every single workout. This makes it easier\nto hold athletes to these standards during the workout and cultivate a culture of virtuosity in one\u2019s gym.\nWe must remember, especially for newer athletes, workout abbreviations and acronyms on the whiteboard are not\nself-evident. A coach may choose to discuss scaling options with the entire class at this time or even review the\nintended stimulus of the workout. This could potentially include describing the targeted time domain, loading, or skil\nacquisition. For example, the workout Elizabeth (21-15-9 repetitions of cleans at 135 lb. and ring dips) is a relatively\nshort workout (about 5 min.), with moderate loading. Novice CrossFit athletes likely have to reduce the load for the"}
{"70": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nclean to their level of moderate loading (e.g., 95 lb.), and they might have to address the dips\u2019 load (e.g., band, bench)\nor volume (e.g., 12-9-6) to best match the original workout intent. See the \u201cProgram Design and Scaling\u201d article for\nmore information about preserving the intended stimulus.\nWhether in the pre-workout brief or the specific warm-up, time should be allotted for athletes to practice the exact\nstandards to be used in the workout. If the movement is loaded, additional time is needed for athletes to work up to\nan appropriate load under the discretion of the trainer.\nWorkout\nOnce the workout begins, the demands on a coach\u2019s abilities increase. Coaching is not about repetition counting\ncheering, or selecting music. It is about appropriately applying threshold training, which means pushing an athlete\u2019s\nintensity while maintaining sound mechanics. This balance is what helps minimize the risk for injury but also keeps\nthe intensity high to drive progress. Deviations in mechanics are inevitable as athletes try to move fast to complete\nthe workout. A coach must attend to each client, using as many different cueing strategies as possible or needed\nand offering encouragement and reinforcement of sound mechanics throughout the workout. A coach may find that\nhe or she actually has to slow an athlete down and/or lower the load, as well as potentially stop them, if there is no\nimprovement in mechanics across multiple repetitions. Movement change is not reserved only for the warm-up. It\nmust continue throughout the workout. A coach is expected to make athletes better during the workout.\nThere are benefits to both the athlete and the coach during the workout. The athlete will receive increased fitness\nadaptations from appropriately increasing speed and load. In addition, he or she should be receiving feedback from\nthe coach on how to improve and refine movement. The coach benefits in this scenario by learning and developing\nseeing and correcting skills in a faster, more dynamic, and less-controlled environment. The ability to deliver action-\nable and effective cues for better movement improves with experience while coaching under high intensity. It is a\npractical, real-time learning opportunity that is focused on effective coaching strategies related to both the athlete\u2019s\nmechanics and motivation.\nPost-workout\nThe main purpose of the post-workout element is to cool down the athletes and program items that will aid in\nrecovery, regaining mental acuity, slowing heart rates and breathing, and facilitating full range of motion about the\njoints (i.e., regaining homeostasis). The coach may also have some secondary goals for this period, such as additiona\nskill work, fitness challenges, education for the athlete, and preparation of the space for the next class. Regardless\na well-conducted post-workout session must include a proper cool-down that leaves clients prepared for the rest of\ntheir day, capable and eager to return and full of appreciation for their accomplishments.\nSome examples of possible cool-down elements are described below. Generally, the cool-down should begin by just\nallowing the athletes to recover for a few minutes. While the athletes are warm and pliable, the cool-down is an excel-\nlent time to stretch or foam roll, especially the areas that were taxed heavily. This can aid recovery, reducing soreness\nwhile potentially helping athletes to gain new range of motion. A coach may leave this as an open period, allowing\nmembers to choose which drills are best for them. A coach-led session, however, ensures everyone has direction\nattention, motivation, and a sense of togetherness.\nA trainer may choose to include skill work at the end of a workout. This can include a review of the movements\nused, especially to correct errors that may have presented themselves during the workout. Using reduced speed and"}
{"71": "Class Structure and Lesson Planning, continued\nload, the trainer can reinforce sound movement mechanics before the athlete leaves. If a trainer filmed an athlete\u2019s\nmovement during the workout, this period can include video playback to review his or her technique. It is also possible\nto work on a totally unrelated skill. While practice is more difficult after a workout due to fatigue, this is precisely why\nattempting new skills here can be beneficial (heightened neurological adaptations due to muscular fatigue).\nA post-workout may include a finisher\u2014an impromptu fitness test such as a maximum set of pull-ups, handstand\nwalking, or rope climbs\u2014anything. It can be part of an ongoing record or a competition, and it can be used as a moti-\nvational event or a chance to reinforce the unknown and unknowable nature of life\u2019s challenges. For example, finish-\ners may be grouped into teams or partners, or the challenge may be structured so one or two athletes compete at a\ntime and the rest of the class can cheer. As in a warm-up, a coach needs to be mindful that finishers do not become\na second workout, nor do they have to be part of every class.\nA coach can use the post-workout period to ensure athletes are recording their workouts. Especially on benchmark\ndays (including strength days), the coach should encourage members to write down their times, repetitions, loads\nand scaling or modifications. The coach should also be able to tell the members the last date the workout was com-\npleted for comparison.\nFinally, a coach can use this time as an educational opportunity to talk about nutrition, programming, scaling, \u201cWhat\nIs Fitness?\u201d or \u201cWhat is CrossFit?\u201d etc., all with the intention of creating smarter athletes.\nThe post-workout/cool-down period gives the coach time to survey athletes and look for mental faculties and visible\nsigns of injury or physical distress. A coach needs to pay attention to verbal and nonverbal cues that an athlete may\nbe under duress. This is also a time for the coach to engage in conversation with athletes by offering encouragement\nand feedback on performance and asking about their physical responses to the workout. Such conversations provide\nvaluable information about the coach\u2019s or facility\u2019s programming. These small connections also lay the groundwork\nfor building a strong community and meaningful relationships with one\u2019s members. The post-workout period is an\noften overlooked or rushed section of class, but it is valuable time, and a coach should use it wisely.\nTo be effective in each class, not only does a coach have to have capacity in all six areas discussed in the \u201cFoundations\nof Effective Training\u201d article, but one must also have a plan. This plan covers all aspects of the class to best improve\none\u2019s athletes with each training session while keeping them safe and excited to return for the next day. After each\nsession, an informal review and critique of one\u2019s own class performance can help the coach better prepare for sub-\nsequent sessions. Self-awareness and critique are critical to development.\nExample lesson plans and scaling options for two workouts are presented on the following pages."}
