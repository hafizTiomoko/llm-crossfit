We have designed our\nprogram to elicit as broad an adaptational response as possible. CrossFit is not\na specialized fitness program but a deliberate attempt to optimize physical com-\npetence in each of 10 fitness domains. They are cardiovascular/respiratory endur-\nance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance,\nand accuracy.\nCrossFit was developed to enhance an individual\u2019s competency at all physical\ntasks. Our athletes are trained to perform successfully at multiple, diverse, and\nrandomized physical challenges. This fitness is demanded of military and police\npersonnel, firefighters, and many sports requiring total or complete physical\nprowess. CrossFit has proven effective in these arenas.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 5 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nFoundations, continued\nAside from the breadth or totality of fitness CrossFit seeks, our program is dis-\ntinctive, if not unique, in its focus on maximizing neuroendocrine response, de-\nveloping power, cross-training with multiple training modalities, constant training\nand practice with functional movements, and the development of successful\ndiet strategies.\nOur athletes are trained to bike, run, swim, and row at short, middle, and long\ndistances, guaranteeing exposure and competency in each of the three main met-\nabolic pathways.\nWe train our athletes in gymnastics from rudimentary to advanced movements,\ngarnering great capacity at controlling the body both dynamically and statically\nwhile maximizing strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility. We also place a heavy\nemphasis on Olympic weightlifting, having seen this sport\u2019s unique ability to devel-\nop an athlete\u2019s explosive power, control of external objects, and mastery of critical\nmotor recruitment patterns. And finally we encourage and assist our athletes to\nexplore a variety of sports as a vehicle to express and apply their fitness.\nAN EFFECTIVE APPROACH\nIn gyms and health clubs throughout the world the typical workout consists of\nisolation movements and extended aerobic sessions. The fitness community from\ntrainers to the magazines has the exercising public believing that lateral raises,\ncurls, leg extensions, sit-ups and the like combined with 20- to 40-minute stints on\nthe stationary bike or treadmill are going to lead to some kind of great fitness. Well,\nat CrossFit we work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high-in-\ntensity cardiovascular sessions. We have replaced the lateral raise with the push\npress, the curl with the pull-up, and the leg extension with the squat. For every\nlong-distance effort our athletes will do five or six at short distance. Why? Because\nfunctional movements and high intensity are radically more effective at eliciting\nnearly any desired fitness result. Startlingly, this is not a matter of opinion but\nsolid, irrefutable scientific fact, and yet the marginally effective old ways persist\nand are nearly universal.

CrossFit endeavors to bring state-of-the-art coaching techniques to the\ngeneral public and athlete.\nIS THIS FOR ME?\nAbsolutely! Your needs and the Olympic athlete\u2019s differ by degree not kind. In-\ncreased power, speed, strength, cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, flexibility,\nstamina, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy are each important to the\nworld\u2019s best athletes and to our grandparents. The amazing truth is that the very\nsame methods that elicit optimal response in the Olympic or professional athlete\nwill optimize the same response in the elderly. Of course, we cannot load your\ngrandmother with the same squatting weight that we would assign an Olympic\nskier, but they both need to squat. In fact, squatting is essential to maintaining\nfunctional independence and improving fitness. Squatting is just one example\nof a movement that is universally valuable and essential yet rarely taught to any\nbut the most advanced of athletes. This is a tragedy. Through painstakingly thor-\nough coaching and incremental load assignment, CrossFit has been able to teach\neveryone who can care for himself or herself to perform safe-\nly and with maximum efficacy the same movements typically\nutilized by professional coaches in elite and certainly exclusive\nenvironments.\nWHO HAS BENEFITED FROM CROSSFIT?\nMany professional and elite athletes are participating in CrossFit.\nPrizefighters, cyclists, surfers, skiers, tennis players, triathletes\nand others competing at the highest levels are using CrossFit to\nadvance their core strength and conditioning, but that is not all.\nCrossFit has tested its methods on the sedentary, overweight,\npathological, and elderly and found that these special popula-\ntions met the same success as our stable of athletes. We call this\n\u201cbracketing.\u201d If our program works for Olympic skiers and over-\nweight, sedentary homemakers then it will work for you.\nYOUR CURRENT REGIMEN\nIf your current routine looks somewhat like what we have de-\nscribed as typical of the fitness magazines and gyms, do not de-\nspair. Any exercise is better than none, and you have not wasted\nyour time. In fact, the aerobic exercise that you have been do-\ning is an essential foundation to fitness, and the isolation move-\nments have given you some degree of strength. You are in good\ncompany; we have found that some of the world\u2019s best athletes\nwere sorely lacking in their core strength and conditioning. It is\nhard to believe, but many elite athletes have achieved interna-\ntional success and are still far from their potential because they\nhave not had the benefit of state-of-the-art coaching methods.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 7 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

First,\nwe are a core strength and conditioning program in the sense that the fitness\nwe develop is foundational to all other athletic\nneeds. This is the same sense in which the uni-\nversity courses required of a particular major\nare called the \u201ccore curriculum.\u201d This is the stuff\nthat everyone needs.

At CrossFit we endeavor\n\u2014COACH GLASSMAN\nto develop our athletes from the inside out, from core to extremity, which is, by\nthe way, how good functional movements recruit muscle, from the core to the\nextremities.\nCAN I ENJOY OPTIMAL HEALTH WITHOUT BEING AN ATHLETE?\nNo! Athletes experience a protection from the ravages of aging and disease that\nnon-athletes never find. For instance, 80-year-old athletes are stronger than\nnon-athletes in their prime at 25 years old. If you think that strength is not import-\nant, consider that strength loss is what puts people in nursing homes. Athletes\nhave greater bone density, stronger immune systems, less coronary heart dis-\nease, reduced cancer risk, fewer strokes, and less depression than non-athletes.\nWHAT IS AN ATHLETE?\nAccording to Merriam Webster\u2019s Dictionary, an athlete is \u201ca person who is trained\nor skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility,\nor stamina.\u201d\nThe CrossFit definition of an athlete is a bit tighter. The CrossFit definition of\nan athlete is \u201ca person who is trained or skilled in strength, power, balance and\nagility, flexibility, and endurance.\u201d CrossFit holds \u201cfitness,\u201d \u201chealth,\u201d and \u201cathleti-\ncism\u201d as strongly overlapping constructs. For most purposes, they can be seen as\nequivalents.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 8 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nFoundations, continued\nWHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO BE AN ATHLETE; I JUST WANT TO BE HEALTHY?\nYou are in luck. We hear this often, but the truth is that fitness, wellness, and pa-\nthology (sickness) are measures of the same entity: your health. There are a mul-\ntitude of measurable parameters that can be ordered from sick (pathological) to\nwell (normal) to fit (better than normal). These include but are not limited to blood\npressure, cholesterol, heart rate, body fat, muscle mass, flexibility, and strength.\nIt seems as though all of the body functions that can go awry have states that are\npathological, normal, and exceptional and that elite athletes typically show these\nparameters in the exceptional range. CrossFit\u2019s view is that fitness and health are\nthe same thing (see \u201cWhat Is Fitness? (Part 1)\u201d article). It is also interesting to notice\nthat the health professional maintains your health with drugs and surgery, each\nwith potentially undesirable side effects, whereas the CrossFit trainer typically\nachieves a superior result always with \u201cside benefit\u201d versus side effect.\nEXAMPLES OF CROSSFIT EXERCISES\nBiking, running, swimming, and rowing in an endless variety of drills.

Here is the good\nnews: World-class age group strength and conditioning is obtainable through an\nhour a day six days per week of training. It turns out that the intensity of training\nthat optimizes physical conditioning is not sustainable past 45 minutes to an hour.\nAthletes who train for hours a day are developing skill or training for sports that in-\nclude adaptations inconsistent with elite strength and conditioning. Past one hour,\nmore is not better!\n\u201cFRINGE ATHLETES\u201d\nThere is a near universal misconception that long-distance athletes are fitter than\ntheir short-distance counterparts. The triathlete, cyclist, and marathoner are of-\nten regarded as among the fittest athletes on Earth. Nothing could be further from\nthe truth. The endurance athlete has trained long past any cardiovascular health\nbenefit and has lost ground in strength, speed, and power; typically does noth-\ning for coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy; and possesses little more than\naverage flexibility. This is hardly the stuff of elite athleticism. The CrossFit athlete,\nremember, has trained and practiced for optimal physical competence in all 10\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 9 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nFoundations, continued\nphysical skills (cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, flexibility, strength,\npower, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy). The excessive aero-\nbic volume of the endurance athletes\u2019 training costs them in speed, power, and\nstrength to the point that their athletic competency has been compromised. No\ntriathlete is in ideal shape to wrestle, box, pole-vault, sprint, play any ball sport,\nfight fires, or do police work. Each of these requires a fitness level far beyond the\nneeds of the endurance athlete. None of this suggests that being a marathoner,\ntriathlete or other endurance athlete is a bad thing; just do not believe that training\nas a long-distance athlete gives you the fitness that is prerequisite to many sports.\nCrossFit considers the sumo wrestler, triathlete, marathoner, and powerlifter to\nbe \u201cfringe athletes\u201d in that their fitness demands are so specialized as to be incon-\nsistent with the adaptations that give maximum competency at all physical chal-\nlenges. Elite strength and conditioning is a compromise between each of the 10\nphysical adaptations. Endurance athletes do not balance that compromise.\nTraditionally,\ncalisthenic AEROBICS AND ANAEROBICS\nThere are three main energy systems that fuel all human activity.

Activities are considered anaerobic when the majority of the\nenergy needed is derived anaerobically. In fact, properly structured, anaerobic ac-\ntivity can be used to develop a very high level of aerobic fitness without the muscle\nwasting consistent with high-volume aerobic exercise! These activities are of less\nthan two minutes in duration and involve moderate to high-power output or inten-\nsity. There are two such anaerobic systems, the phosphagen (or phosphocreatine)\nsystem and the lactic acid (or glycolytic) system. Examples of anaerobic activity\ninclude running a 100-meter sprint, squatting, and doing pull-ups.\nAnaerobic and aerobic training support performance variables like strength, pow-\ner, speed, and endurance. We also support the contention that total conditioning\nand optimal health necessitate training each of the physiological systems in a sys-\ntematic fashion (see \u201cWhat is Fitness?

All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nFoundations, continued\nIt warrants mention that in any activity all three energy systems are utilized\nthough one may dominate. The interplay of these systems can be complex, yet a\nsimple examination of the characteristics of aerobic versus anaerobic training can\nprove useful.\nCrossFit\u2019s approach is to judiciously balance anaerobic and aerobic exercise in a\nmanner that is consistent with the athlete\u2019s goals. Our exercise prescriptions ad-\nhere to proper specificity, progression, variation, and recovery to optimize\nadaptations.\nTHE OLYMPIC LIFTS, A.K.A., WEIGHTLIFTING\nThere are two Olympic lifts, the clean and jerk and\nthe snatch. Mastery of these lifts develops the\nsquat, deadlift, power clean, and split jerk while\nintegrating them into a single movement of un-\nequaled value in all of strength and conditioning.\nThe Olympic lifters are without a doubt the world\u2019s\nstrongest athletes.\nThese lifts train athletes to effectively activate more\nmuscle fibers more rapidly than through any other\nmodality of training. The explosiveness that results\nfrom this training is of vital necessity to every sport.\nPracticing the Olympic lifts teaches one to apply\nforce to muscle groups in proper sequence; i.e.,\nfrom the center of the body to its extremities (core\nto extremity). Learning this vital technical lesson benefits all athletes who need\nto impart force to another person or object, as is commonly required in near-\nly all sports.\nIn addition to learning to impart explosive forces, the clean and jerk and snatch\ncondition the body to receive such forces from another moving body both safely\nand effectively.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated the Olympic lifts\u2019 unique capacity to devel-\nop strength, muscle, power, speed, coordination, vertical leap, muscular endur-\nance, bone strength, and the physical capacity to withstand stress. It is also worth\nmentioning that the Olympic lifts are the only lifts shown to increase maximum\noxygen uptake, the most important marker for cardiovascular fitness.\nSadly, the Olympic lifts are seldom seen in the commercial fitness community be-\ncause of their inherently complex and technical nature. CrossFit makes them avail-\nable to anyone with the patience and persistence to learn.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 11 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

This places a unique premi-\num on the improvement of strength-to-weight ratio. Unlike other strength training\nmodalities, gymnastics and calisthenics allow for increases in strength only while\nincreasing strength-to-weight ratio!\nGymnastics develops pull-ups, squats, lunges, jumping, push-ups, and numerous\npresses to handstand, scales, and holds. These skills are unrivaled in their benefit\nto the physique, as evident in any competitive gymnast.\nAs important as the capacity of this modality is for strength development, it is with-\nout a doubt the ultimate approach to improving coordination, balance, agility, ac-\ncuracy, and flexibility. Through the use of numerous presses, handstands, scales,\nand other floor work, the gymnast\u2019s training greatly enhances kinesthetic sense.\nThe variety of movements available for inclusion in this modality probably exceeds\nthe number of exercises known to all non-gymnastic sport! The rich variety here\ncontributes substantially to CrossFit\u2019s ability to inspire great athletic confidence\nand prowess.\nFor a combination of strength, flexibility, well-developed physique, coordina-\ntion, balance, accuracy, and agility, the gymnast has no equal in the sports world.\nThe inclusion of this training modality is absurdly absent from nearly all train-\ning programs.\nROUTINES\nThere is no ideal routine! In fact, the chief value of any routine lies in abandon-\ning it for another. The CrossFit ideal is to train for any contingency. The obvious\nimplication is that this is possible only if there is a tremendously varied quality to\nthe breadth of stimulus. It is in this sense that CrossFit is a core strength and con-\nditioning program. Anything else is sport-specific training, not core strength and\nconditioning.\nAny routine, no matter how complete, contains within its omissions the parame-\nters for which there will be no adaptation. The breadth of adaptation will exact-\nly match the breadth of the stimulus. For this reason, CrossFit embraces short-,\nmiddle-, and long-distance metabolic conditioning, and low, moderate, and heavy\nload assignment. We encourage creative and continuously varied compositions\nthat tax physiological functions against every realistically conceivable combination\nof stressors. This is the stuff of surviving fights and fires. Developing a fitness that\nis varied yet complete defines the very art of strength and conditioning coaching.\nThis is not a comforting message in an age when scientific certainty and special-\nization confer authority and expertise.

CrossFit\u2019s success in elevating the\nperformance of world-class athletes lies clearly in demanding of our athletes total\nand complete physical competence. No routine takes us there.\nNEUROENDOCRINE ADAPTATION\n\u201cNeuroendocrine adaptation\u201d is a change in the body that affects you either neu-\nrologically or hormonally. Most important adaptations to exercise are in part or\ncompletely a result of a hormonal or neurological shift. Research has shown which\nexercise protocols maximize neuroendocrine responses. Earlier we faulted isola-\ntion movements as being ineffectual. Now we can tell you that one of the critical\nelements missing from these movements is that they invoke essentially no neuro-\nendocrine response.\nAmong the hormonal responses vital to athletic development are substantial\nincreases in testosterone, insulin-like growth factor, and human growth hor-\nmone. Exercising with protocols known to elevate these hormones eerily\nmimics the hormonal changes sought in exogenous hormonal therapy (ste-\nroid use) with none of the deleterious effect. Exercise regimens that induce a\nhigh neuroendocrine response produce champions! Increased muscle mass and\nbone density are just two of many adaptive responses to exercises capable of pro-\nducing a significant neuroendocrine response.\nIt is impossible to overstate the importance\nof the neuroendocrine response to exercise\nprotocols.

That is about as simple as we\ncan get. Many have observed that keeping your grocery cart to the perimeter of the\ngrocery store while avoiding the aisles is a great way to protect your health. Food\nis perishable. The stuff with long shelf life is all suspect. If you follow these simple\nguidelines, you will benefit from nearly all that can be achieved through nutrition.\nTHE CAVEMAN OR PALEOLITHIC MODEL FOR NUTRITION\nModern diets are ill suited for our genetic composition. Evolution has not kept pace\nwith advances in agriculture and food processing, resulting in a plague of health\nproblems for modern man. Coronary heart disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoporo-\nsis, obesity, and psychological dysfunction have all been scientifically linked to a\ndiet too high in refined or processed carbohydrate. The caveman model is perfect-\nly consistent with CrossFit\u2019s prescription.\nWHAT FOODS SHOULD I AVOID?\nExcessive consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates is the primary culprit in\nnutritionally caused health problems. High-glycemic carbohydrates are those that\nraise blood sugar too rapidly. They include rice, bread, candy, potato, sweets, so-\ndas, and most processed carbohydrates. Processing can include bleaching, bak-\ning, grinding, and refining.

The first, the phosphagen, dominates the highest-powered activ-\nities, those that last less than about 10 seconds. The second pathway, the glycolytic,\ndominates moderate-powered activities, those that last up to several minutes. The\nthird pathway, the oxidative, dominates low-powered activities, those that last in\nexcess of several minutes.\nTotal fitness, the fitness that CrossFit promotes and develops, requires competency\nand training in each of these three pathways or engines. Balancing the effects of\nthese three pathways largely determines the how and why of the metabolic condi-\ntioning or \u201ccardio\u201d that we do at CrossFit.\nFavoring one or two to the exclusion of the others and not recognizing the impact\nof excessive training in the oxidative pathway are arguably the two most common\nfaults in fitness training. More on that later.\nCROSSFIT\u2019S FOURTH FITNESS MODEL: SICKNESS-WELLNESS-FITNESS\nCONTINUUM\nThere is another aspect to CrossFit\u2019s fitness that is of great interest and immense\nvalue to us. We have observed that nearly every measurable value of health can be\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 20 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

The Sickness-Wellness-Fitness Continuum.\nplaced on a continuum that ranges from sickness to wellness to fitness (Figure 4).\nThough tougher to measure, we would even add mental health to this observation.\nDepression is clearly mitigated by proper diet and exercise.\nFor example, a blood pressure of 160/95 is pathological, 120/70 is normal or healthy,\nand 105/55 is consistent with an athlete\u2019s blood pressure; a body fat of 40 percent\nis pathological, 20 percent is normal or healthy, and 10 percent is fit. We observe a\nsimilar ordering for bone density, triglycerides, muscle mass, flexibility, high-density\nlipoprotein (HDL) or \u201cgood cholesterol,\u201d resting heart rate, and dozens of other com-\nmon measures of health (Table 2). Many authorities (e.g., Mel Siff, the NSCA) make a\nclear distinction between health and fitness. Frequently they cite studies that sug-\ngest that the fit may not be health protected. A close look at the supporting evidence\ninvariably reveals the studied group is endurance athletes and, we suspect, endur-\nance athletes on a dangerous fad diet (high carbohydrate, low fat, low protein).\nDone right, fitness provides a great margin of protection against the ravages of\ntime and disease. Where you find otherwise, examine the fitness protocol, espe-\ncially diet. Fitness is and should be \u201csuper-wellness.\u201d Sickness, wellness, and fitness\nare measures of the same entity. A fitness regimen that does not support health is\nnot CrossFit.\nCOMMON GROUND\nThe motivation for the four models is simply to ensure the broadest and most gen-\neral fitness possible. Our first model evaluates our efforts against a full range of\ngeneral physical adaptations; in the second the focus is on breadth and depth of\nperformance; with the third the measure is time, power and consequently energy\nsystems; and the fourth is on health markers. It should be fairly clear that the fitness\nthat CrossFit advocates and develops is deliberately broad, general, and inclusive.\nOur specialty is not specializing. Combat, survival, many sports, and life reward this\nkind of fitness and, on average, punish the specialist.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 21 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

Let\nus look at how CrossFit incorporates metabolic conditioning (\u201ccardio\u201d), gymnastics,\nand weightlifting to forge the world\u2019s fittest men and women.\nMETABOLIC CONDITIONING, OR \u201cCARDIO\u201d\nBiking, running, swimming, rowing, speed skating, and cross-country skiing are col-\nlectively known as \u201cmetabolic conditioning.\u201d In the common vernacular they are re-\nferred to as \u201ccardio.\u201d CrossFit\u2019s third fitness model, the one that deals with metabolic\npathways, contains the seeds of the CrossFit \u201ccardio\u201d prescription. To understand\nthe CrossFit approach to \u201ccardio\u201d we need first to briefly cover the nature and in-\nteraction of the three major pathways.\nOf the three metabolic pathways the first two, the phosphagen and the glycolytic,\nare \u201canaerobic\u201d and the third, the oxidative, is \u201caerobic.\u201d We need not belabor the\nbiochemical significance of aerobic and anaerobic systems; suffice it to say that\nunderstanding the nature and interaction of anaerobic exercise and aerobic exer-\ncise is vital to understanding conditioning. Just remember that efforts at moderate\nto high power and lasting less than several minutes are predominantly anaerobic\nand efforts at low power and lasting in excess of several minutes are predominant-\nly aerobic. As an example, the sprints at 100, 200, 400, and 800 meters are largely\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 22 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

Aerobic conditioning allows us to engage in low-power extended efforts effi-\nciently (cardio/respiratory endurance and stamina). This is critical to many sports.\nAthletes engaged in sports or training where a preponderance of the training load\nis spent in aerobic efforts witness decreases in muscle mass, strength, speed, and\npower. It is not uncommon to find marathoners with a vertical leap of only sever-\nal inches! Furthermore, aerobic activity has a pronounced tendency to decrease\nanaerobic capacity. This does not bode well for most athletes or those interested\nin elite fitness.\nAnaerobic activity also benefits cardiovascular function and decreases body fat!\nIn fact, anaerobic exercise is superior to aerobic exercise for fat loss! Anaerobic\nactivity is, however, unique in its capacity to dramatically improve power, speed,\nstrength, and muscle mass. Anaerobic conditioning allows us to exert tremendous\nforces over brief time intervals. One aspect of anaerobic conditioning that bears Blur the distinction\ngreat consideration is that anaerobic conditioning will not adversely affect aerobic between strength\ncapacity. In fact, properly structured, anaerobic activity can be used to develop a\ntraining and\nvery high level of aerobic fitness without the muscle wasting consistent with high\nmetabolic\nvolumes of aerobic exercise! The method by which we use anaerobic efforts to\ndevelop aerobic conditioning is \u201cinterval training.\u201d conditioning for the\nsimple reason that\nBasketball, football, gymnastics, boxing, track events under one mile, soccer,\nnature\u2019s challenges\nswimming events under 400 meters, volleyball, wrestling, and weightlifting are all\nsports that require the vast majority of training time to be spent in anaerobic activ- are typically blind to\nity.

Pay close attention to the physiques of the athletes\ncompeting at 100, 200, 400, and 800 meters and the milers. The difference you are\nsure to notice is a direct result of training at those distances.\nINTERVAL TRAINING\nThe key to developing the cardiovascular system without an unacceptable loss\nof strength, speed, and power is interval training. Interval training mixes bouts\nof work and rest in timed intervals. Table 3 gives guidelines for interval training.\nWe can control the dominant metabolic pathway conditioned by varying the du-\nration of the work and rest interval and number of interval repetitions. Note that\nthe phosphagen pathway is the dominant pathway in intervals of 10\u201330 seconds\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 23 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

(Part 1), continued\nof work followed by rest of 30\u201390 seconds\n(work:recovery 1:3) repeated 25\u201330 times.\nThe glycolytic pathway is the dominant path-\nway in intervals of 30\u2013120 seconds of work\nfollowed by rest of 60\u2013240 seconds (work:re-\ncovery 1:2) repeated 10\u201320 times. And final-\nly, the oxidative pathway is the dominant\npathway in intervals of 120\u2013300 seconds of\nwork followed by rest of 120\u2013300 seconds\n(work:recovery 1:1) repeated 3\u20135 times. The\nbulk of metabolic training should be inter-\nval training.\nInterval training need not be so structured\nor formal. One example would be to sprint\nbetween one set of telephone poles and\njog between the next set, alternating in this\nmanner for the duration of a run.\nOne example of an interval that CrossFit\nmakes regular use of is the Tabata interval,\nwhich is 20 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of rest repeated eight times.\nDr. Izumi Tabata published research that demonstrated that this interval protocol\nproduced remarkable increases in both anaerobic and aerobic capacity.\nIt is highly desirable to regularly experiment with interval patterns of varying com-\nbinations of rest, work, and repetitions.\nSome of the best resources on interval training come from Dr. Stephen Seiler. His\narticles on interval training and the time course of training adaptations contain\nthe seeds of CrossFit\u2019s heavy reliance on interval training. The article on the time\ncourse of training adaptations explains that there are three waves of adaptation\nto endurance training. The first wave is increased maximal oxygen consumption.\nThe second is increased lactate threshold. The third is increased efficiency. In the\nCrossFit concept, we are interested in maximizing first-wave adaptations and\nprocuring the second systemically through multiple modalities, including weight\ntraining, and avoiding completely third-wave adaptations. Second- and third-wave\nadaptations are highly specific to the activity in which they are developed and can\nbe detrimental with too much focus to the broad fitness that we advocate and de-\nvelop. A clear understanding of this material has prompted us to advocate regular\nhigh-intensity training in as many training modalities as possible through largely\nanaerobic efforts and intervals while deliberately and specifically avoiding the ef-\nficiency that accompanies mastery of a single modality. It is at first ironic that our\ninterpretation of Dr. Seiler\u2019s work was not his intention, but when our quest of\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 24 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

This is very important: with interval training we get all of the\ncardiovascular benefit of endurance work without the attendant loss of strength,\nspeed, and power.\nGYMNASTICS\nOur use of the term \u201cgymnastics\u201d not only includes the traditional competitive\nsport that we have seen on TV but all activities like climbing, yoga, calisthenics,\nand dance, where the aim is body control. It is within this realm of activities that we\ncan develop extraordinary strength (especially upper body and trunk), flexibility,\ncoordination, balance, agility, and accuracy. In fact, the traditional gymnast has no\npeer in terms of development of these skills.\nCrossFit uses short parallel bars, mats, still rings, pull-up and dip bars, and a climb-\ning rope to implement our gymnastics training.\nThe starting place for gymnastic competency lies with the well-known calisthenic\nmovements: pull-ups, push-ups, dips, and rope climbs. These movements need\nto form the core of your upper-body strength work. Set goals for achieving bench-\nmarks like 20, 25, and 30 pull-ups; 50, 75, and 100 push-ups; 20, 30, 40, and 50 dips;\n1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 consecutive trips up the rope without any use of the feet or legs.\nAt 15 pull-ups and dips each, it is time to start working regularly on a \u201cmuscle-up.\u201d\nThe muscle-up is moving from a hanging position below the rings to a supported\nposition, arms extended, above the rings. It is a combination movement contain-\ning both a pull-up and a dip. Far from a contrivance, the muscle-up is hugely func-\ntional. With a muscle-up, you will be able to surmount any object on which you\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 25 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

The value here for\nsurvival, police, firefighter, and military use is impossible to overstate. Pull-ups and\ndips are the key to developing the muscle-up.\nWhile developing your upper-body strength with the pull-ups, push-ups, dips, and\nrope climbs, a large measure of balance and accuracy can be developed through\nmastering the handstand. Start with a headstand against the wall if you need to.\nOnce reasonably comfortable with the inverted position of the headstand, you\ncan practice kicking up to the handstand again against a wall. Later take the hand-\nstand to the short parallel bars or parallettes without the benefit of the wall. Af-\nter you can hold a handstand for several minutes without benefit of the wall or a\nspotter it is time to develop a pirouette.

A football field or sidewalk is an excellent place to practice and\nmeasure your progress. You want to be able to walk 100 yards in the handstand\nwithout falling.\nCompetency in the handstand readies the athlete for handstand presses. There is\na family of presses that range from relatively easy ones that any beginning gym-\nnast can perform to ones so difficult that only the best gymnasts competing at\nnational levels can perform. Their hierarchy of difficulty is bent arm/bent body\n(hip)/bent leg; straight arm/bent body/bent leg; straight arm/bent body/straight\nleg; and bent arm/straight body/straight leg; and finally the monster: straight arm/\nstraight body/straight leg.

We recommend that everyone read Dr. Sears\u2019\nbook \u201cEnter the Zone\u201d (see also \u201cZone Meal Plans\u201d article).\nSPORT\nSport plays a wonderful role in fitness. Sport is the application of fitness in a fan-\ntastic atmosphere of competition and mastery. Training efforts typically include\nrelatively predictable repetitive movements and provide limited opportunity for\nthe essential combination of our 10 general physical skills. It is, after all, the com-\nbined expression, or application, of the 10 general skills that is our motivation for\ntheir development in the first place. Sports and games like soccer, martial arts,\nbaseball, and basketball, in contrast to our training workouts, have more varied\nand less predictable movements. But, where sports develop and require all 10\ngeneral skills simultaneously, they do so slowly compared to our strength and con-\nditioning regimen. Sport is better, in our view, at expression and testing of skills\nthan it is at developing these same skills. Both expression and development are\ncrucial to our fitness. Sport, in many respects, more closely mimics the demands\nof nature than does our training. We encourage and expect our athletes to engage\nin regular sports efforts in addition to all of their strength and conditioning work.\nA THEORETICAL HIERARCHY OF DEVELOPMENT\nA theoretical hierarchy exists for the development of an athlete\n(Figure 5). It starts with nutrition and moves to metabolic con-\nditioning, gymnastics, weightlifting, and finally sport.

If you only work your weight training at low reps you will\nnot develop the localized muscular endurance that you might have otherwise. If\nyou work high reps exclusively you will not build the same strength or power that\nyou would have at low reps. There are advantages and disadvantages to working\nout slowly or quickly, with high weights or low weights, completing \u201ccardio\u201d before\nor after, etc.\nFor the fitness that we are pursuing, every parameter within your control needs\nto be modulated to broaden the stimulus as much as possible.

The magic is in the\nmovements not the routine. Be creative.\nAnother favorite is to blend elements of gymnastics and weightlifting in couplets\nthat combine to make a dramatic metabolic challenge. An example would be to\nperform 5 reps of a moderately heavy back squat followed immediately by a set of\nmax-reps pull-ups repeated 3\u20135 times.\nOn other occasions we will take five or six elements balanced between weightlift-\ning, metabolic conditioning, and gymnastics and combine them in a single circuit\nthat we blow through three times without a break.\nWe can create routines like this forever.

Nature\nhas no regard for this distinction or any other, including our 10 physical adapta-\ntions. We will use weights and plyometrics training to elicit a metabolic response\nand sprinting to improve strength.\nSCALABILITY AND APPLICABILITY\nThe question regularly arises as to the applicability of a regimen like CrossFit\u2019s to\nolder and deconditioned or untrained populations. The needs of an Olympic ath-\nlete and our grandparents differ by degree not kind. One is looking for functional\ndominance, the other for functional competence.

Firemen, soccer players, triathletes, boxers, and\nsurfers all want programs that conform to the specificity of their needs. While we\nadmit that there are surely needs specific to any sport, the bulk of sport-specific\ntraining has been ridiculously ineffective. The need for specificity is nearly com-\npletely met by regular practice and training within the sport, not in the strength\nand conditioning environment.

(PART 2)\nAdapted from Coach Glassman\u2019s Feb 21, 2009, L1 lecture.\nThis concept started with me having what I call \u201ca belief in fitness.\u201d\nI was (and still am) of the view that there is a physical capacity that would lend\nitself generally well to any and all contingencies\u2014to the likely, to the unlikely, to\nthe known, to the unknown. This physical capacity is different than the fitness\nrequired for sport. One of the things that demarcates sport is how much we know\nabout the event\u2019s physiological demands. Instead, we are chasing headlong this\nconcept of fitness\u2014as a broad, general and inclusive adaptive capacity\u2014a fitness\nthat would prepare you for the unknown and the unknowable.\nAnd we went to the literature to look for such a definition and could not find any-\nthing. The information we did find seemed esoteric, irrelevant, or flawed\u2014logically\nand/or scientifically. For example, to date the American College of Sports Med-\nicine (ACSM) cannot give a scientific definition of fitness. They give a definition,\nbut it contains nothing that can be measured. If it is not measurable, it is not a\nvalid definition.\nTHE FIRST THREE MODELS\nAnd so we started playing with a definition and came out with three operational\nmodels. They were clumsy, but they had utility: They guided us and kept us on\nthis path towards this fitness.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 32 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nWhat Is Fitness? (Part 2), continued\nThe first model originated from Jim Cawley and Bruce Evans of Dynamax med-\nicine balls. They produced a list of physiological adaptations that represented\nthe gamut of potential physiological adaptations in an exercise program. You\ncan improve cardiorespiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power,\nspeed, coordination, accuracy, agility and balance by exercising. They gave rea-\nsonable definitions to each of these 10 so that they seemed fairly distinct. Keep\nin mind, however, nature has no obligation to recognize these distinctions. They\nare completely manmade. This model is an abstraction to help us understand\nfitness better.

Instead, you are\nadvancing a very narrow bandwidth of a specialized capacity. only on these terms.\u201d\n\u2014COACH GLASSMAN\nEveryone probably knows what it is he or she does not want to see come out of the\nhopper. What I have learned about fitness, about sport training, about preparing\nyourself for the unknown and the unknowable is this: There is more traction, more\nadvantage, more opportunity in pursuing headlong that event or skill that you do\nnot want to see come out of the hopper than putting more time into the ones\nwhere you already excel. That thing you do not want to see come out of the hopper\nis a chink in your armor. It is a glaring deficiency in your general physical prepared-\nness (GPP). And fixing it will give advantage where it does not always make sense\nmaybe mechanically or metabolically.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 33 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nWhat Is Fitness? (Part 2), continued\nWe have countless examples of this from amateur and professional sports. At the\nheart of this is that we have learned some things about GPP that the world never\nknew before. There is more opportunity of advancing athletic performance via\nadvancing GPP than there is in more sport-specific strength and conditioning\ntraining. For example, I am not sure why more pull-ups make for better skiers,\nbut they do. We have some theories why that occurs, but we do not actually need\nto know the mechanism. We are focused on advancing performance.\nSo the second model is a statistical model using skills and drills. I am looking for a\nbalance of capacity across training modalities.\nThe third model uses the three metabolic pathways. These are the three engines\nthat produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the currency of effort of all energy\noutput. Power is plotted on the Y-axis and duration of effort (time) on the X-axis.\nThe first pathway (phosphagen or phosphocreatine) is high powered and short\nduration. It can account for about 100 percent of max human output and taps out\nat about 10 seconds. The second pathway (lactate or glycolytic) is moderate pow-\nered, moderate duration. It accounts for approximately 70 percent of max pow-\ner output, peaks at about 60 seconds and terminates at 120 seconds. The third\npathway (oxidative or aerobic) is low powered, long duration. It accounts for ap-\nproximately 40 percent of max power output and does not fade in any reasonable\ntime for which I have the patience to measure. The phosphagen and the glycolytic\npathways are anaerobic; oxidative is aerobic. All three engines work all the time to\nsome extent. The degree to which each is active is dependent on the activity. One\nidles, while the other two rev; two will rev, one will idle, etc.\nOur thought is this: He or she is as fit as he or she is balanced in capacity in all\nthree of these engines. A human being is a vehicle with three engines. Suppose we\ndiscover there is a fourth engine; we want capacity there, too. We develop capacity\nin all engines through our prescription: constantly varied functional movement\nexecuted at high intensity. We are looking for a balance in the bioenergetics (the\nengines that fuel all human activity).\nDEFINITION OF FITNESS (2002-2008)\nAlthough clumsy, these three models served as a litmus test for the fitness we\nwere after. And we moved forward. We launched CrossFit.com and posted the\nWorkout of the Day (WOD): constantly varied, high-intensity functional movement.\nWe were collecting the data from doing WODs and started asking: \u201cWhat does it\nreally mean to do Fran?

Complete the work-\nout by doing 21 thrusters (front squat 95 lb., then drive it overhead), then 21 pull-\nups (get your chin over a bar from a hang anyhow). Then go back to the thrusters\nfor 15 repetitions, 15 pull-ups, 9 of each, stop the clock, and we get a total time\nfor the effort.\nPower is force times distance (work) divided by time. The work required to do Fran\nis constant (force times distance). It does not change unless your height changes\n(distance), the distance we travel (the movement\u2019s range of motion) changes, the\nload changes (95 lb.), or your weight changes. This means that every time you do\nFran or a specific benchmark workout, the work is constant.\nSo, you do Fran for the first time and have a Time 1 for it (T1). If you do it a year lat-\ner, the same work was completed but you have a separate time (T2). In comparing\nthe two efforts, we find that the work quantity cancels and the difference in time\nis the difference in power produced (Table 1).\nThere will be measurement error in this calculation. I can measure the force/\nweight with a scale, the distance traveled with a tape measure, and time with a\nwatch. There is not a lot of error therein, but there are some concerns as we are\ncalculating the body\u2019s displacement by using the center of mass, for example.\nHowever, as long as the work is constant, the same error occurs with every effort.\nAnd in comparison from one effort to the next, the errors cancel each other out\n(zero order error). This ratio of time (T2/T1) describes my progress to the accuracy\nand precision of the watch, which is the best of my three tools (stopwatch, tape\nmeasure, scale).\nBy tracking the difference in time between workout attempts, we are looking at\nchanges in power. We did not have to study this much longer to come to this un-\nderstanding that your collection of workout data points represented your work\ncapacity across broad time and modal domains. This is your fitness.\nWith power on the Y-axis and duration of effort on the X-axis, the power output\nof any effort can be plotted. Take a handful of efforts that take approximately 10\nseconds to do, measure their power output individually, and then get an average\nof these efforts. Repeat this exercise at 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 60 min-\nutes, etc. Plot these data points. With adequate scientific accuracy and precision, I\nhave graphed mathematically an individual\u2019s work capacity across broad time and\nmodal domains (Figure 1).\nA FOURTH MODEL AND THE DEFINITION OF HEALTH (2008)\nAlong the way in using these three models, we had also observed that there was\na continuum of measures from sickness to wellness to fitness. If it was a measure\nI could quantify, something of interest to a physician or exercise physiologist, we\nfind it would sit well ordered on this pattern.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 36 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

A Graphical Representation of One\u2019s Fitness (Work Capacity)\nat a Certain Time in His or Her Life.\nTake body fat, for example. If you are 40 percent body fat, that is considered mor-\nbidly obese. The numbers vary by community, but 15 percent is often considered\nwell or normal. Five percent is typically what you would see in an elite athlete. Bone\ndensity follows a similar pattern. There is a level of bone density that is pathologi-\ncal; it is osteoporosis or osteopenia in early stages. There is a value that is normal.\nWe find gymnasts with three to five times normal bone density. I can do this with\na resting heart rate, flexibility (any of the 10 general physical skills), and even some\nsubjective things to which we cannot put numbers through analytical methods\n(e.g., mood). I do not know of a metric that runs counter to this pattern. This obser-\nvation led us to believe that fitness and health were varying different measures of\nthe same reality.\nThis also means that if you are fit, you first have to become well to become patho-\nlogically sick.

First, understand that our defini-\ntions of these quantities are measurable. One of the problems with exercise sci-\nence is that it would very rarely meet the rigors of any real science (chemistry,\nphysics, engineering).\nSecondly, it is also almost never about exercise. For example, maximal oxygen\nconsumption (VO2 max) and lactate threshold are correlates, maybe components,\nbut absolutely subordinate to what happens to work capacity. Who would take an\nincrease in VO2max for a decrease in work capacity across broad time and modal\ndomains? What that would look like is breathing more air than you ever had before\non a treadmill test in a lab but losing the road race. Similarly, someone\u2019s lactate\nthreshold could increase, but he or she still gets choked out in the fight because of\nlack of work capacity.\nI could make a list of hundreds of these metrics, and no one has ever produced\na great athlete by advancing them one at a time. It does not happen. I can move\nthem best by doing constantly varied, high-intensity functional movements; doing\nthings that look like Fran, Diane, Helen; turning fitness into sport by working with\nfixed workloads and trying to minimize the time by making every workout a com-\npetitive effort among the cohort. And when I do that, what we find is that these\nmetrics do spectacular things.\nSuppose a man at 90 years old is living independently, running up and down the\nsteps and playing with his grandchildren. We would not be concerned if his choles-\nterol numbers were \u201chigh.\u201d There is a problem looking only at longevity. Imagine\na curve that stretches to 90 or even 105 years but has very low work capacity for\nits duration. That is not what CrossFit is about: It is about vitality and capacity.\nWhat can you do?\nIt is imperative for making meaningful assertions about training that fitness and\nhealth are measurable. The area (or volume) under the curve gives me a scientif-\nically accurate, precise and valid measure of an athlete\u2019s fitness (or health). And\nwe are the first to have ever done that. When we showed this to physicists, chem-\nists, engineers, they agreed there is no other way to assess the capacity of some-\nthing, be it a rocket, motorcycle, truck or human.

Include a range of activities\u2014like three pulls on the Concept2 row-\ner for average watts to a 10-mile run\u2014and a multitude of workouts in between.\nLearn the mechanics Compile their overall placing across these events, and everyone then has a reason-\nof fundamental able metric of his or her total capacity.\nmovements,\nThis quantification of fitness is a part of a broader concept that is at the heart of\nestablish a\nthis movement: We call it evidence-based fitness.

While I would rather be one of the two fittest\nprogramming.\u201d than the eight dead, and I do not know if I want to play, I am not going to attach a\nnormative value to it. The real tragedy comes in not knowing the safety numbers.\n\u2014COACH GLASSMAN\nThese three vectors of safety, efficacy and efficiency point in the same direction,\nsuch that they are not entirely at odds with each other. I can greatly increase the safe-\nty of a program by turning the efficacy and efficiency down to zero. I can increase\nthe efficiency by turning up the intensity and then possibly compromising safety. Or\nI could damage the efficacy by losing people. Safety, efficacy and efficiency are the\nthree meaningful aspects of a program. They give me all I need to assess it.\nThis quantification of fitness, by choosing work capacity as our standard for the\nefficacy of the program, necessitates the qualification of movement. Our quantifi-\ncation of fitness introduces qualification of movement.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 40 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nTechnique, continued\nFor the qualification of movement there are four common terms: mechanics,\ntechnique, form and style. I will not delve into them with too much detail: The\ndistinction is not that important. I use both technique and form somewhat inter-\nchangeably, although there is a slightly nuanced distinction.\nWhen I talk about angular velocity, momentum, leverage, origin or insertion of\nmuscles, torque, force, power, relative angles, we are taking about mechanics.\nWhen I speak to the physics of movement, and especially the statics and less so\nthe dynamics, I am looking at the mechanics.\nTechnique is the method to success for completion of a movement. For example, if\nyou want to do a full twisting dismount on the rings, the technique would be: pull,\nlet go, look, arm up, turn, shoulder drop, etc. Technique includes head posture and\nbody posture. And there are effective and less effective techniques. Technique\nincludes the mechanics, but it is in the macro sense of \u201chow do you complete the\nmovement without the physics?\u201d\nForm is the normative value: This is good or this is bad\u2014\u201cyou should\u201d or \u201cyou\nshouldn\u2019t\u201d applied to mechanics and technique.\nStyle is essentially the signature to a movement; that is, that aspect of the move-\nment that is fairly unique to you. The best of the weightlifting coaches can look at\nthe bar path during a lift and tell you which lifter it is. There are aspects to all of our\nmovements that define us like your thumbprint. It is the signature. To be truly just\nthe signature, style elements have no bearing on form, technique or mechanics.\nStyle does not enter into the normative assessment, is not important to technique,\nand does not alter substantially the physics.\nThese four terms are all qualifications to movement. I want to speak generally to\ntechnique and form to include all of this, but what we are talking about here is the\nnon-quantification of output; that is, how you move.\nBy taking power or work capacity as our primary value for assessing technique\u2014\nand this reliance on functional movement\u2014we end up in kind of an interesting posi-\ntion. We end up where power is the successful completion of functional movement.\nThis is not about merely energy exerted. On a graph, you could put work complet-\ned on the X-axis and energy expended on the Y-axis. Someone could potentially\nexpend a lot of energy and do very little work by being inefficient. Ideally, what that\nindividual would do would see little energy expended for the maximum amount of\nwork. Technique is what maximizes the work completed for the energy expended\n(Figure 1). For any given capacity, say metabolically, for energy expenditure, the\nguy who knows the technique is going to be able to do the most amount of work.\nSuppose I take two people at random and they are both trying the same task. One\nis familiar with how to deadlift, and one is not. One knows how to clean, one does\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 41 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nTechnique, continued\nFigure 1. Technique Maximizes the Work Accomplished for the Energy Expended.\nnot. One knows how to drive overhead, one does not. Suppose they are loading\na truck with sandbags. The one familiar with lifting large objects and transporting\nthem is going to do a lot more work.\nYou can have the argument as to who is stronger. For example, you can use an\nelectromyogram and see with what force the biceps shortens. If you are defining\nstrength as contractile potential, you may end up with the guy with enormous\ncontractile potential\u2014but not knowing the technique of the clean, the jerk, the\ndeadlift, he cannot do as much work.\nWe, however, do not take contractile potential as the gold standard for strength.\nStrength is the productive application of force. If you cannot complete work, if you\ncannot express strength as power, if strength cannot be expressed as productive\nresult, it does not count. Having enormous biceps and quadriceps is useless if you\ncannot run, jump, lift, throw, press.\nThis is related to safety, efficacy and efficiency because technique (quality of\nmovement) is the heart of maximizing each of these.\nHe or she who knows how to do these movements when confronted with them\nwill get a better result in terms of safety. Two individuals attempt to lift a heavy\nobject; one knows how to pop a hip and get under it (clean), and the other guy\nstarts to pull with a rounded back. I can tell you what is likely to happen to he or\nshe who does not know how to lift. If you want to stay safe, you better have good\ntechnique, good form.\nEfficacy, for any given contractile potential, for any given limit to your total meta-\nbolic capacity, he or she who knows the technique will be able to get more work\ndone and will develop faster. If after six months of teaching you how to clean it\nstill does not look like I would like it to, you will not get twice body weight over-\nhead more quickly than someone who looks like a natural. You want an effective\nprogram, you are going to have to move with quality, you want to get the result\nquickly\u2014technique is going to be pivotal to your success.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 42 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nTechnique, continued\nTechnique is an intimate part of safety, efficacy, and efficiency.\nWe can see how this manifests in CrossFit workouts by way of a comparison. I want\nto look at typing, shooting, playing the violin, NASCAR driving and CrossFit. What\nthese domains have in common is that a marked proficiency is associated with\nspeed. Being able to shoot accurately and quickly is better than quickly or accurately.\nYou may try to get a job as a typist because you do not make any mistakes. How-\never, for this perfection, you type at a rate of 20 words a minute and only use two\nfingers. You will never get hired. Playing the violin fast and error-free is critical for\na virtuoso. However, someone who gets through \u201cFlight of the Bumblebee\u201d in 12\nminutes is not there yet. A NASCAR driver wants to both drive fast and not wreck.\nIn CrossFit, a perfectly exquisite Fran is worthless if it takes 32 minutes.\nAnd yet, it is presented to CrossFit coaches as, \u201cShould I use good form or should I\ndo it quickly?\u201d I do not like my choices. One is impossible without the other.\nTechnique and speed are not at odds with one another, where \u201cspeed\u201d is related\nto all the quantification of the movement: power, force, distance, time. They are\nseemingly at odds. It is a misapprehension. It is an illusion.\nCan you learn to drive fast without wrecking? Can you learn to type fast without\nmaking errors? Can you shoot quickly without missing? Eventually, but not in the\nlearning. One is impossible without the other.\nYou will not learn to type fast without typing where you make a ton of errors and\nthen work to reduce the errors at that speed. Then you go faster, and then again\npull the errors back in, then go faster and pull the errors back in. You drive faster\nand faster and then you spin out in the infield or you hit the wall.\nIf you are a race driver and you have never spun out, gone out in the infield or nev-\ner been in a wreck, you are not very good. If you are a typist and you have never\nmade a mistake, you are very slow. In CrossFit, if your technique is perfect, your\nintensity is always low.\nHere is the part that is hard to understand: You will not maximize the intensity or\nthe speed without mistakes. But it is not the mistakes that make you faster. It is not\nreaching for the letter P with your pinky and hitting the O. It is not hitting the wrong\nnote that made you play faster. It is not missing the target by two feet that made\nyou a better shooter. It is not running into the wall that made you a faster driver.\nBut you will not get there without it. The errors are an unavoidable consequence\nof development.\nThis iterative process of letting this scope of errors broaden then reducing them\nwithout reducing the speed is called \u201cthreshold training.\u201d\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 43 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nTechnique, continued\nIn a CrossFit workout, if you are moving well, I will tell you to pick up the speed.\nSuppose at the higher speed the movement still looks good: I will encourage you\nto go faster. And if it still looks good I will encourage you to go even faster. Now the\nmovement starts falling apart.\nI do not want you to slow down yet. First, at that speed I want you to fix your tech-\nnique. What you need to do is continuously and constantly advance the margins\nat which form falters.\nIt may be that initially at 10,000 foot-pounds per minute my technique is perfect,\nbut it falls apart at 12,000 foot-pounds per minute. Work at that 10,000 to 12,000\nfoot-pounds per minute mark to fix the form, and soon enough you will have great\ntechnique at 12,000 foot-pounds per minute. The next step is to achieve that tech-\nnique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute.\nAt first, the technique at 14,000 foot-pounds per minute will suffer. Then you must\nnarrow it in. That is the process. It is ineluctable. It is unavoidable. There is nothing\nI can do about it. That is not my rule.\nWe are the technique people. We drill technique incessantly, but simultaneously I\nwant you to go faster. You will learn to work at higher intensity with good technique\nonly by ratcheting up the intensity to a point where good technique is impossible.\nThis dichotomy means that it is impossible at the limits of your capacity to obey\nevery little detail and nuance of technique. Some of the refined motor-recruitment\npatterns are not going to always look perfect.\nI do not know of a domain where speed matters and technique is not at the heart\nof it. In every athletic endeavor where we can quantify the output, there is incred-\nible technique at the highest levels of performance.\nSuppose someone set the new world record for the shot put, but his technique was\npoor. This means one of two things: one, either with good technique it would have\ngone farther, or two, we were wrong in understanding what is good technique.\nTechnique is everything. It is at the heart of our quantification. You will not express\npower in significant measure without technique. You might expend a lot of ener-\ngy, but you will not see the productive application of force. You will not be able to\ncomplete functional tasks efficiently or effectively. You will not be safe in trying.\nThere is a perceived paradox here that really is not a paradox when you under-\nstand the factors at play.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 44 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

It is against the grain of what occurs at most\ncommercial gyms. They have machines; we detest them. They use isolation\nmovements; we use compound movements. They use low intensity; we use high\nintensity. Everything about this message is for many people antithetical to all\nthey thought they knew. With nutrition, the theme continues: What most every-\none thinks is wrong.\nIn July of 1989 in the Archives of Internal Medicine, Norman Kaplan wrote an\nabsolutely breathtaking bit of research. It is an analysis that has gone com-\npletely unchallenged. He was able to demonstrate by an operative mechanism,\nthrough correlation, and more importantly causally, that hyperinsulinism is at\nthe root of the \u201cdeadly quartet\u201d (i.e., upper-body obesity, glucose intolerance,\nhypertriglyceridemia and hypertension). Hyperinsulinism\u2014too much insulin\u2014\nwas the cause.\nIf you are healthy, insulin is the normal and essential response to the ingestion of\ncarbohydrate. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, and you cannot\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 45 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nNutrition: Avoiding Disease and Optimizing Performance, continued\nlive without it. You can either produce insulin through the pancreas, you can\ninject it, or you can die. Insulin is responsible for storage of energy in cells. (Glu-\ncagon is the counter-regulatory hormone to insulin: It releases the energy out of\nthe cells.) And one of the things that insulin puts into cells is fat.\nYou can see that the way to get your insulin level too high (hyperinsulinism) is to\neat too much carbohydrate. How much carbohydrate is that? In the qualitative\nsense, your insulin level is \u201ctoo high\u201d if it is driving up your blood pressure, mak-\ning you fat or reducing your ability to suppress blood sugar after eating carbo-\nhydrate. If you are glucose intolerant, hypertensive or your triglycerides are too\nhigh, you are getting too much insulin and thus too much carbohydrate. These\nare risk factors for heart disease, and the process by which we induce athero-\nsclerotic disease\u2014arteries paved over with plaque. This leads to thrombosis, oc-\nclusion, myocardial infarct and debilitation and death. But when physicians are\npolled \u201cwhat is it that you do not want to get?\u201d cancer and heart disease do not\nrate nearly so high as does Type 2 diabetes.\nAnd I can tell you how to get it. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a receptor down-\ngrade phenomenon on the liver, muscle, and fat cells. They have a receptor site\nwhere insulin attaches. It is similar to a key fitting in a lock\u2014specific shapes on\neach allow them to bind together. When insulin binds to the receptor, the cell can\nnow receive all good things, including amino acids (proteins) and fat.\nIf you expose yourself to too much insulin, the cells and receptors become \u201cblind\u201d\nto it. The key does not work as well in the lock; i.e., receptor downgrade phenom-\nenon. The mechanism is not really much different mechanically than staring at\nthe sun. At first, your eyes see light, but if you do it for a few minutes, you will\nnever see any light again. You just burned out the receptors. That is what hap-\npens in Type 2 diabetes.\nWhat was revolutionary about Kaplan\u2019s work is that it disproved an accepted\nmodel. Traditionally, what was observed over tens of years was that individuals\noften first gained weight (obesity), then their cholesterol went up (hypercholes-\nterolemia), then their blood pressure went up (hypertensive), and then they be-\ncome diabetic. There was an assumption\u2014and it is a classical logical fallacy\u2014that\nthe ordering suggested causality. That because this happened first, then this\u2014it\nwas the root cause of all the other conditions. This model is now understood to\nbe fatally flawed (i.e., a post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy). Order of events does\nnot necessitate causality.\nKaplan was able to demonstrate with powerful evidence that hyperinsulinism\nwas the cause of all these conditions, the cause of atherosclerotic disease and\ncardiac death. All of this is collectively known as coronary heart disease (CHD).\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 46 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nNutrition: Avoiding Disease and Optimizing Performance, continued\nThere has been a very powerful shift and re-understanding that what is causing\nheart disease is not dietary-fat intake but excessive consumption of carbohy-\ndrate. Things like the French paradox show that there is no paradox. The para-\ndigm was flawed. The French eat many times the fat that Americans do and yet\nhave a much smaller frequency of heart disease. They also consume just a little\nbit under 5 percent of the refined sugar we do. We are eating about 150 lb. of\nsugar per man, woman, and child annually.\nIt is amazing what efforts we will exert to consume sugar. Your interest in car-\nbohydrates, and it is profound, is really no different than your interest in beer\nor opiates. Sugar tickles the brain and it feels good. And the excuses and things\npeople will do to get to that high are unbelievable.\nNow I tell you how to avoid all of that.\nEat a diet of meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch\nand no sugar.\nDo that and you are exempt.\nMeat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, no sugar\u2014and no\ncoronary heart disease.\nIt has nothing to do with genetics. The genetic part is an intolerance to excess\namounts of carbohydrate. It is no different than having a genetic predisposition\nto alcoholism. Having the gene for alcoholism does not mean it will necessarily be\nexpressed. You would have to drink alcohol. If you do not drink alcohol, you prob-\nably will not suffer from alcoholism, at least not in the clinical manifestation of it.\nIt is no different with atherosclerotic disease. I do not care what your grandfather\ndied of, your mother died of, your uncle died of, your brother died of. For exam-\nple, Dr. Barry Sears, all his uncles and father died at 49 years old from atheroscle-\nrotic-induced thrombosis, myocardial infarct, heart attack. All of them. He is not\ngoing to. He is not eating the carbohydrates they ate.\nEat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, no sugar. To\nget to the same endpoint, these are effective nutritional strategies for avoiding\nheart disease, death and misery:\n1) If you could not have harvested it out of your garden or farm and eaten it\nan hour later, it is not food.\n2) Shop around the perimeter of the grocery store, and do not go down the\naisles.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 47 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

You do not see that on the\nchicken. It is not on the tomatoes. But it is on the chips and cookies.\n4) If it is not perishable, if it says \u201cBest if used before 2019,\u201d it is not food.\nIn 1995, we were delivering almost the same lecture with just less clinical experi-\nence. And people were like: \u201cYou are kidding me?\u201d and \u201cFat makes you fat, right?\u201d\nIt is not true.\nOPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE\nThe next layer to diet is about optimizing performance. Through a diet of meat\nand vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, no sugar, you will not be\nso lucky as to optimize your output. To get a sub-three-minute Fran, you need to\nweigh and measure your meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, fruit and starch,\nand you need to eliminate sugar.\nI wish it were not true. I wish the path of fitness was riding bicycles and drinking\nbeer. I wished that is how we did it. It does not work. What you have to do is eat\nmeat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, no sugar, and then\nget a scale and measuring cup. You need accuracy and precision to your consump-\ntion or you will never get in a jet stream of elite performance.\nIf you want to have top-fuel-type performance, you need top fuel. I wish it were\notherwise. What do I base this on? No one has ever demonstrated to me anything\nbut inferior capacity on a diet where they did not weigh and measure.\nI am not telling you that you have to weigh and measure your food. But I am telling\nyou that you are not going to get anywhere in terms of optimizing your perfor-\nmance on a bad diet. And we have seen enough incidences now. I have worked\nwith tens of thousands of people: No one has ever done it.\nYou need to weigh and measure your food. Not forever, but at least to start. It is\nalso good to go back to weighing and measuring once in a while. What happens is\nthat the portion requirements diminish for all the foods you do not like. \u201cYes, I only\nneed one spear of asparagus. Ice cream? I think it was a pound.\u201d You will bias in the\nwrong direction.\nI can take any cohort, get one of them to weigh and measure food, and he or she\nwill pull away. There are very few things you can do short of doing more pull-ups\nthat can get you more pull-ups other than eating the way we recommend it. There\nis a one-to-one correspondence between elite CrossFit performance and the accu-\nracy and precision of their consumption.\nAnd what you are going to find is performance improvement after performance\nimprovement, but at some point you will want to stop the athlete from leaning out\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 48 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nNutrition: Avoiding Disease and Optimizing Performance, continued\nfurther. It is possible you will get too lean to perform well. You may find a plateau in\nyour output, and then you need to ratchet it up. (I do the same thing for hard gain-\ners; I increase their intake as I do not need them to lean out.) The first step: When\nyou get as lean as you want to be and before there is a diminution in performance,\ndouble the fat. If you do not feel a whole lot better, maybe try three times the fat.\nAnd if that does not feel a whole lot better, and instead you just get thicker, then go\nback to two times the fat. But I would let performance tell me what to do. In making\nmodifications, I want to see any kind of change in physiognomy. I have more room\nto play with when someone has extra padding; I have to be more careful with\nsomeone who is already ripped.\nThe formula for calculating what is relevant and pertinent to your prescription is\nlean body mass and activity level. Done. There is not an inherent difference for\nmen versus women, for young versus old. I want to know how active you are and\nI want to know what your lean body mass is. And everything else is not germane,\nnot pertinent, not relevant. It is extraneous information.\nIn the vagaries and contingencies of everyday living, such as schedules and appe-\ntite, there are fluctuations in intake that will occur without weighing and measur-\ning. Following these normal fluctuations puts you on a coarser path versus the fine\npath required for optimized performance. And that is why you will not get there by\nluck. It is also possible an average CrossFit athlete becomes extraordinary this way.\nCommitment and focus are going to overcome genetic limitations. If you commit\nto the effort, you stand a much better chance. We have had this fantastic experi-\nence of playing with this. In any cohort, one pulls away when he or she is weighing\nand measuring food in this 40-30-30 milieu of macronutrient intake.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 49 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

High-density lipoproteins (HDL\ncholesterol), for instance: At less than 35 mg/dL you have a problem, 50 mg/dL is\nnice, and 75 mg/dL is a whole lot better. Blood pressure: 195/115 mm/Hg you have\na problem, 120/70 mm/Hg is healthy, and 105/50 mm/Hg looks more like an ath-\nlete. Triglycerides, bone density, muscle mass, body fat, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c,\naka glycated hemoglobin)\u2014all can be plotted relative to these three values.\nThe significance is that these are the predictors, the cause, and the manifesta-\ntion of chronic disease. Chronic diseases include obesity, coronary heart disease,\nType 2 diabetes, stroke, cancer (to include breast, colon and lung, but my theory\nis this will include all the positron-emission-tomography-positive cancers eventu-\nally, which are 95 percent of all cancers), Alzheimer\u2019s, peripheral artery disease,\nadvanced biological aging, drug addiction, among others.\nIt is very likely that if you have any chronic disease, you have deranged markers. If\nyou have Alzheimer\u2019s, you would see your HDL suppressed, your blood pressure\nup, your triglycerides up, your body fat up, your muscle mass down, your bone\ndensity down, your HbA1c high, etc. The same is true with diabetes. The same is\ntrue with most cancers.\nMedicine has no effective treatment for chronic disease: It is symptomatic only.\nThe doctor gives you a drug to bring your cholesterol down, a different drug to\nraise your bone density. You might need bariatric surgery if you have morbid obe-\nsity. If you have paved-over coronary arteries, they can do bypass surgery. If you\nbecome glucose intolerant, the doctor can put you on insulin. But all of these are\nnot fixes. They are masking the problem.

We will teach people how to swim, and when\nthey do not pay attention, and they go under, the doctors take care of it.\nAccidents are largely stuff you can do nothing about, but there is one exception. Be\nfit. Kinetic: We hear stories from war of CrossFit athletes who survive things that\npeople have not survived previously. Toxicity: Someone who is fitter is more likely\nto survive the same poisoning than someone who is not. Genetic: There are genes\nyou have inherited that will or will not express because of your behavior through\ndiet and exercise. Microbic: Who is most vulnerable to viral pneumonia? The frail,\nthe feeble. So fitness offers a protection here.\nBut assume there is no protection from fitness because what you need in terms\nof preventing accidents largely is luck. Luck\u2014there is no \u201cgood luck\u201d versus \u201cbad\nluck\u201d\u2014looks like not having these things happen to you. Seventy percent of what\nkills people can be addressed by what CrossFit trainers do, and the other 30 per-\ncent of deaths occur based on luck, so get fit and do not think about luck. If you\nstand around worried about germs, worried about the tire that is going to come\nthrough the windshield, worried about breathing toxic air, and worried about your\ngenes, you are wasting your time. It will not make you happy. It will not make you\nbetter. It will not make you safer. You are not going to live any longer.\nThis sums to my \u201ckinetic theory of health.\u201d The singular focus on kinematics\u2014in-\ncreasing work capacity, increasing your fitness\u2014is how to avoid chronic disease.\nJust get a better Fran time, better deadlift, better Diane time, and do all the things\nthat would support a better Fran time\u2014like eating meat and vegetables, nuts and\nseeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar; getting plenty of sleep; and maybe\ntaking some fish oil. After that, we are out of stuff that matters. With that singular\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 51 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nFitness, Luck and Health, continued\nfocus on work capacity, we can avoid chronic disease and there is nothing really\nto worry about. You have the lifestyle answer. Make it to the gym, eat like we tell\nyou, and enjoy yourself. We have hacked health. Here is the magic formula for you:\nFitness + Luck (bad) = Health.\nIt is the part you can do something about plus the part you can do nothing about\nthat sums to your outcome. So make the most out of fitness and you will not be\npart of the seven out of 10 who die unnecessarily due to lifestyle. In the end, chron-\nic disease is a deficiency syndrome. It is sedentation with malnutrition.\nThe cost of chronic disease is such that U.S. medical expenditure is now about\n$4 trillion a year. In 2008, Pricewaterhousecoopers estimated that roughly half of\nall U.S. medical expenditure was wasted on unnecessary procedures, administra-\ntive inefficiencies, treatment of preventable conditions and so on. Add in fraud\nand abuse and we are wasting well more than a trillion dollars. We also know 86\npercent of overall health-care spending goes to treating the chronically diseased\nineffectively. Of the remaining 14 percent, half goes to the stuff that medicine can\nactually do something about. That means seven percent of health-care spending\nis not wasted. The amount spent on chronic disease is a waste.\nWhat CrossFit trainers are providing is non-medical health care. When doctors\ntreat those affected by accidents (the 30 percent), that is medical health care. If\nyou are confused about the two, it is easy to distinguish by methods and tools. If\nsomeone is cut open, given radiation, prescribed pills, injected with syringes, it is\nmedicine. It is treatment by a doctor.\nOn our side, it looks like CrossFit. We have rings, dumbbells, pull-up bars, our own\nbodies\u2014and the prescription is universal. It is not to treat disease. It does not mat-\nter where you fall on this continuum: You get put on the same program. If the pre-\nscription is universal, it cannot be medicine. If it is something everyone needs\u2014like\nair or oxygen\u2014that is not medicine. Without vitamin C, you can get scurvy. Should\nphysicians control orange and lemon groves, onion and kale production because\nthey have vitamin C that you cannot live without? We do not want them doing that\nto food. We cannot let them do that to exercise, and there is a powerful movement\nwith a lot of funding afoot to do exactly that. Millions of dollars are being spent\nto bring exercise into the purview of the medical arena so that it falls under the\nAffordable Care Act.\nWe have 13,000 gyms with 2 to 4 million people safe from chronic disease right\nnow. This community is doing a lot of good things on a lot of fronts. Yet our gyms\nare thriving not because of our impact on chronic disease. They are thriving be-\ncause the end users, the customers, are extremely happy with the transformation.\nAnd it is part physical, part emotional, part health markers, part relationships.\nThat is the miracle of CrossFit: People are getting something that they did not even\nknow they wanted or needed.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 52 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

When properly com-\nposed, the right diet can nudge every important quantifiable marker for health in\nthe right direction.\nDiet is critical to optimizing human function, and our clinical experience leads us to\nbelieve that Dr. Barry Sears\u2019 Zone Diet closely models optimal nutrition.\nCrossFit\u2019s best performers are Zone eaters. When our second-tier athletes commit\nto strict adherence to the Zone parameters, they generally become top-tier per-\nformers quickly. It seems that the Zone Diet accelerates and amplifies the effects\nof the CrossFit regimen.\nUnfortunately, the full benefit of the Zone Diet is largely limited to those who have\nat least at first weighed and measured their food.\nFor a decade, we experimented with sizing and portioning strategies that avoid\nscales, and measuring cups and spoons, only to conclude that natural variances in\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 53 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nZone Meal Plans, continued\ncaloric intake and macronutrient composition without measurement are greater\nthan the resolution required to turn good performance to great. Life would be\nmuch easier for us were this not so!\nThe 1-Block Equivalents for Protein, Fat, and Carbohydrates (Figure 1, Table 3) and\nSample Zone Meals and Snacks (Table 4) have been our most expedient approach\nfor eliciting athletes\u2019 best performances and optimal health.\nEven discounting any theoretical or technical content, this portal to sound nutri-\ntion still requires some basic arithmetic and weighing and measuring portions for\nthe first weeks.\nToo many athletes, after supposedly reading Sears\u2019 book \u201cEnter the Zone,\u201d still ask,\n\u201cSo what do I eat for dinner?\u201d They get meal plans and block charts. We can make\nthe Zone more complicated or simpler, but not more effective.\nWe encourage everyone to weigh and measure portions for a couple weeks\nbecause it is supremely worth the effort, not because it is fun. If you choose to\n\u201cguesstimate\u201d portions, you will have the result of CrossFit\u2019s top performers only\nif and when you are lucky.\nWithin a couple of weeks of weighing and measuring, you will have developed an\nuncanny ability to estimate the mass of common food portions, but, more impor-\ntantly, you will have formed a keen visual sense of your nutritional needs. This is a\nprofound awareness.\nIn the Zone scheme, all of humanity calculates to either 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-block meals\nat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with either 1- or 2-block snacks between lunch and\ndinner and again between dinner and bedtime. We have simplified the process for\ndetermining which of the four meal sizes and two snack sizes best suits your needs\n(Table 1). We assume that you are doing CrossFit; i.e., active.\nBeing a \u201c4-blocker,\u201d for instance, means that you eat three meals each day, where\neach meal is composed of 4 blocks of protein, 4 blocks of carbohydrate, and 4\nblocks of fat. Whether you are a \u201csmallish\u201d medium-sized guy or a \u201clargish\u201d medi-\num-sized guy would determine whether you will need snacks of 1 or 2 blocks twice\na day (Table 2).\nThe \u201cmeal plans\u201d we give stand as examples of 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-block meals, and the\n\u201cblock chart\u201d gives quantities of common foods equivalent to 1 block of protein,\ncarbohydrate, or fat.\nOnce you determine that you need, say, 4-block meals, it is simple to use the block\nchart and select four times something from the protein list, four times something\nfrom the carbohydrate list, and four times something from the fat list every meal.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 54 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nZone Meal Plans, continued\nOne-block snacks are chosen from the block chart at face value for a single snack\nof protein, carbohydrate, and fat, whereas 2-block snacks are, naturally, composed\nof twice something from the carbohydrate list combined with twice something\nfrom the protein list and twice something from the fat list.\nEvery meal, every snack, must contain equivalent blocks of protein, carbohy-\ndrate, and fat.\nIf the protein source is specifically labeled \u201cnon-fat,\u201d then double the usual fat\nblocks for that meal. Read \u201cEnter the Zone\u201d to learn why.\nFor those eating according to Zone parameters, body fat comes off fast. When\nour men fall below 10 percent body fat and start approaching 5 percent, we kick\nup the fat intake. The majority of our best athletes end up at X blocks of protein, X\nblocks of carbohydrate, and 4X or 5X blocks of fat. Learn to modulate fat intake to\nproduce a level of leanness that optimizes performance.\nThe Zone Diet neither prohibits nor requires any particular food. It can accommo-\ndate paleo or vegan, organic or kosher, fast food or fine dining, while delivering the\nbenefits of high-performance nutrition.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 55 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

If the athlete chooses the wrong block\nsize and does not obtain the desired results, the plan can be modified after a few\nweeks. Errors in block selection might slow progress, but initial errors are offset by\nthe huge value in starting a practice of weighing and measuring intake.\nSears details a more precise method to calculate one\u2019s block prescription in \u201cEnter\nthe Zone.\u201d It is:\nZone block prescription = lean body mass (lb.) x activity level (g/lb. of lean\nbody mass) / 7 (g protein/block)\nThe activity level ranges on a scale of 0-1. For those who work out several days a\nweek and do not have a labor-intensive job, the activity level should be 0.7 (most\nCrossFit athletes). By dividing 0.7 by 7 g in the equation, this simplifies to a Zone\nblock prescription that is 10 percent of his or her lean mass.\nThe activity factor should increase if the athlete does CrossFit two or more times a\nday, trains for another sport in addition to CrossFit, or holds a strenuous daily job\n(e.g., construction, farming, etc., and potentially coaching, if on one\u2019s feet all day).\nAlthough CrossFit workouts are relatively intense, they are not long in duration.\nAn individual does not need to increase the activity level value based on intensity\nalone; activity volume determines activity factor.\nSAMPLE CALCULATION OF THE ZONE BLOCK PRESCRIPTION\nSuppose an athlete is 185 lb. (84 kg) with 16 percent body fat. He does CrossFit five\ndays per week and works in a typical office environment. A sample calculation of\nhis Zone block prescription follows.\nFirst, lean body mass is calculated (calipers are a convenient, easy-to-use, and rea-\nsonably accurate method):\nlean body mass = 185 lb.\u2013(0.16 x 185 lb.) = 185 lb.\u201329.6 lb. = 155.4 lb.\nBecause the activity factor is 0.7, the simplified formula is used:\nblock prescription = 155.4 lb. x 0.10 = 15.54 or ~15 blocks\nThis means that the example athlete above would eat 15 blocks per day (Table 1).\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 65 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

MACRONUTRIENT AND CALORIE COMPOSITION\nFOR 15 BLOCKS A DAY\nProtein 15 blocks x 7 g = 105 g (420 calories)\nCarbohydrate 15 blocks x 9 g = 135 g (540 calories)\nFat 15 blocks x 3 g = 45 g (405 calories)\nTotal Calories = 1,365\nNote the total calories presented here are underestimated due to hidden calories.\nMost foods are classified by a single macronutrient, despite the presence of some\nother macronutrients (e.g., nuts are classified as a fat but have some protein and\ncarbohydrate calories). These less predominant macronutrients for each source\nare not included in the total calorie calculations.\nThis athlete could also choose to round up to 16 blocks, particularly if he or she is\nmore likely to have compliance issues. The Zone prescription is a calorie-restrictive\ndiet and can be especially difficult for new adopters. When one\u2019s calculation has a\ndecimal value, rounding up to the next whole block might result in slower progress\nbut produce better long-term compliance. Once the athlete has become accus-\ntomed to the diet, then the total blocks can be rounded down to 15, particularly if\ndesired body composition has not been achieved.\nINCREASING FAT INTAKE\nThe caloric restriction leans out the athlete while providing enough protein and\ncarbohydrate for typical CrossFit activity levels. However, the athlete can become\ntoo lean. The athlete is considered \u201ctoo lean\u201d when performance decreases in\ncombination with continued weight loss. \u201cToo lean\u201d should not be based on body\nweight or appearance alone. When a loss of mass coincides with a drop in perfor-\nmance, the athlete needs to add calories to the diet. This can be accomplished by\ndoubling the fat intake (Table 2).\nTABLE 2.

We contend that eating a diet composed of known\nquantities and of high-quality whole foods is the most important aspect of nutri-\ntion for improved performance and health. Not only are supplements generally\npoorer nutrient sources, but they are also an unnecessary focus for someone not\nfollowing our basic diet plan of weighed and measured meat and vegetables, etc.\nHowever, we find one supplement beneficial enough to make a blanket recom-\nmendation: fish oil. Fish oil provides omega-3 fatty acids, which are a type of poly-\nunsaturated fat.\nPhysiological fats are known as triglycerides in biological terms; they are composed\nof a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached (Figure 1). The attached fatty\nacids are mixtures of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats. Al-\nthough one fatty acid is prominent in each food, all three are represented to some\ndegree. Figure 2 provides a summary of the types of fat and example food sources.\nThe two types of polyunsaturated fats found most frequently in foods are ome-\nga-3 and omega-6 fats. Classifying a fatty acid as omega-3 versus omega-6 is\ndependent on chemical structure. Polyunsaturated fats are sources of the two\nessential fatty acids, meaning they must be obtained from the diet. They are al-\npha-linolenic acid (ALA) (an omega-3) and linoleic acid (LA) (an omega-6). Ome-\nga-3 fats are known as \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d fats, and omega-6 fats are known as\n\u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d fats based on their physiological functions. Both are needed\nin relatively equal quantities.\nFigure 1. Fat in Food is in the Form of a Triglyceride.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 68 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nSupplementation, continued\nFigure 2. Summary of Fatty Acids and Example Food Sources.\nCurrent diets tend to have too many omega-6 fats, pushing the balance toward\npro-inflammatory physiological processes. The current omega-6:omega-3 ratio is\napproximately 20:1 and higher, where primitive populations likely had a ratio clos-\ner to 2:1. Sources of omega-6 fats in the diet are vegetable oils, nuts, convention-\nally raised (grain-fed/feed-lot) meat and eggs, and farm-raised fish. Eliminating\nprocessed food from our diet should reduce exposure to omega-6 fats from veg-\netable oils. However, most meat and eggs are conventionally raised, which results\nin greater omega-6 content than if they were wild or grass fed. Nuts and seeds also\nhave more omega-6 fats than omega-3. Therefore, it is possible that even though\none eats the foods on our list, his or her diet could still be pro-inflammatory rela-\ntive to the ancestral past.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 69 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nSupplementation, continued\nFish-oil supplementation improves the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids\nand reduces the inflammatory responses in the body. Fish oil provides two types\nof omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid\n(DHA), the form of omega-3 fats preferred by the brain and body. The body can\nconvert ALA to EPA and DHA, but the conversion process is inefficient. Some prac-\ntitioners have recommended a combined daily intake on the order of 3 grams of\nEPA and DHA for an otherwise healthy individual, although the exact amount is\ndictated by one\u2019s total omega-6 intake. Each brand of fish oil has a different con-\ncentration of EPA and DHA per serving as indicated on the label. Individuals might\nhave to take multiple servings to get 3 grams of EPA and DHA, as brands might\ninclude omega-3s that are neither EPA nor DHA (e.g., ALA). Flax seed or oil is not an\nappropriate supplement for omega-3s. Flax is a good source of ALA, but because\nof the poor conversion to EPA and DHA, it is not recommended. If the individual is\nvegan, DHA can be obtained with algae oil.\nResearch has indicated positive health benefits by supplementing with fish oil.\nOmega-3 fats help increase the fluidity of cell membranes, and research has in-\ndicated supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular function,\nnervous-system function, immune health, memory, and mood issues. Omega 3s\nalso function as an anti-coagulant, so military personnel should consider remov-\ning fish oil supplements from their diet a couple of weeks prior to deployment.\nIt might also be appropriate for those with an upcoming surgery to stop taking\nfish oil two weeks from that date. These individuals should talk with their doctor\nregarding these circumstances.\nIt is possible to avoid omega-3 supplementation depending on food intake, al-\nthough the individual needs to be fastidious with his or her diet. This could be\naccomplished by avoidance of all vegetable oils (which are used at most every\nrestaurant), and nuts and seeds. Meat would have to be grass-fed and eggs pas-\nture-raised, and wild-caught fish should be consumed a few times a week. Be-\ncause this is not practical for many people, supplementation is effective.\nBesides the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3s in the diet, the total amount of poly-\nunsaturated fat is an important consideration. It is not ideal to take in high doses\nof either omega-6 (vegetable oils, nuts) or omega-3 fats (based on the stability of\npolyunsaturated fats relative to other fats, Figure 2). Fish oil supplementation does\nnot negate the effects of a bad diet (e.g., eating fast food or excessive amounts of\nnuts and nut butters). The total recommended polyunsaturated fat intake in a diet\nis not well established; an equal representation of the three fats appears prudent.\nIndividuals should work with a primary care doctor to determine if supplementa-\ntion is appropriate, particularly in cases with specific medical conditions.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 70 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

The regimen is at odds with the seven-day week. Many of\nour clients are running programs within professional settings, where the five-day\nworkweek with weekends off is de rigueur. Others have found that the scheduling\nneeds of family, work, and school require scheduling workouts on specific days of\nthe week every week. For these people we have devised a five-days-on, two-days-\noff regimen that has worked very well.\nThe workout of the day was originally a five-on, two-off pattern and it worked per-\nfectly. But the three-on, one-off pattern was devised to increase both the intensity\nof and recovery from the workouts, and the feedback we have received and our\nobservations suggest that it was successful in this regard.\nIf life is easier with the five-on, two-off pattern, do not hesitate to employ it.

There are other factors that\nwill ultimately overshadow any disadvantages inherent in the potentially less ef-\nfective regimen, such as convenience, attitude, exercise selection, and pacing.\nFor the remainder of this article the three-day cycle is the one in discussion, but\nmost of the analysis and discussion applies perfectly to the five-day cycle.\nELEMENTS BY MODALITY\nLooking at the Template Macro View (Table 1) it can readily be seen that the tem-\nplate is based on the rotation of three distinct modalities: monostructural meta-\nbolic conditioning (M), gymnastics (G), and weightlifting (W). The monostructural\nmetabolic conditioning activities are commonly referred to as \u201ccardio,\u201d the pur-\npose of which is primarily to improve cardiorespiratory capacity and stamina.\nThey are repetitive, cyclical movements that could be sustained for long periods\nof time. The gymnastics modality comprises body-weight exercises/elements or\ncalisthenics, and its primary purpose is to improve body control by improving\nneurological components such as coordination, balance, agility, and accuracy, and\nto improve functional upper-body capacity and trunk strength. The weightlifting\nmodality comprises the most important weight-training basics, Olympic lifts and\npowerlifting, where the aim is primarily to increase strength, power, and hip/leg\ncapacity. This category includes any exercise with the addition of an external load.\nTable 2 gives the common exercises used by our program, separated by modality,\nin fleshing out the routines.\nFor metabolic conditioning the exercises are run, bike, row, and jump rope. The\ngymnastics modality includes air squats, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, handstand\npush-ups, rope climbs, muscle-ups, presses to handstands, back/hip extensions,\nsit-ups, and jumps (vertical, box, broad, etc.). The weightlifting modality includes\nTABLE 2.

Days 1, 5, and 9 are each single-modality workouts whereas days\nof gymnastics\n2, 6, and 10 include two modalities each (couplets), and finally, days 3, 7, and 11 use\npractice and skills is three modalities each (triplets). In every case each modality is represented by a\nsingle exercise or element; i.e., each M, W, and G represents a single exercise from\ndeficient.\u201d\nmetabolic conditioning, weightlifting, and gymnastics modalities respectively.\n\u2014COACH GLASSMAN\nWhen the workout includes a single exercise (days 1, 5, and 9) the focus is on a\nsingle exercise or effort. When the element is the single \u201cM\u201d (day 1) the workout is\na single effort and is typically a long, slow, distance effort. When the modality is a\nsingle \u201cG\u201d (day 5) the workout is practice of a single skill, and typically this skill is\nsufficiently complex to require great practice but might not be yet suitable for in-\nclusion in a timed workout because performance is not yet adequate for efficient\ninclusion. When the modality is the single \u201cW\u201d (day 9) the workout is a single lift and\ntypically performed at high weight and low repetition. It is worth repeating that the\nfocus on days 1, 5, and 9 is single efforts of \u201ccardio\u201d at long distance; improving\nhigh-skill, more complex gymnastics movements; and single/low-rep heavy\nweightlifting basics, respectively. This is not the day to work sprints, pull-ups, or\nhigh-repetition clean and jerks \u2014the other days would be more appropriate.\nTABLE 3.

This is in stark contrast\nto the two-element days, where the elements are of a much higher intensity. This\nworkout is tough, extremely tough, but managing work-rest intervals is a mar-\nginal factor.\nEach of the three distinct days has a distinct character. Generally speaking, as the\nnumber of elements increases from one to two to three, the workout\u2019s effect is\ndue less to the individual element selected and more to the effect of repeated\nefforts. Table 4 depicts workout examples following this template.\nAPPLICATION\nThe template in discussion does not generate the CrossFit.com Workout of the\nDay (WOD), but the qualities of one-, two-, and three-element workouts expressed\nthere motivated the template\u2019s design. Our experience in the gym and the feed-\nback from our athletes following the WOD have demonstrated that the mix of one-,\ntwo-, and three-element workouts is crushing in impact and unrivaled in bodily re-\nsponse. The information garnered through your feedback on the WOD has given\nCrossFit an advantage in estimating and evaluating the effect of workouts that\nmight have taken decades or been impossible without the internet.\nTypically our most effective workouts, like art, are remarkable in composition,\nsymmetry, balance, theme, and character. There is a \u201cchoreography\u201d of exertion\nthat draws from a working knowledge of physiological response, a well-developed\nsense of the limits of human performance, the use of effective elements, experi-\nmentation, and even luck. Our hope is that this model will aid in learning this art.\nThe template encourages new skill development, generates unique stressors,\ncrosses modes, incorporates quality movements, and hits all three metabolic\npathways. It does this within a framework of sets and reps and a cast of exercis-\nes that CrossFit has repeatedly tested and proven effective. We contend that this\ntemplate does a reasonable job of formally expressing many CrossFit objectives\nand values.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 76 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

Many athletes need to \u201cscale\u201d (i.e., modify)\nthe workouts for the safest implementation of the program. Finding a CrossFit\naffiliate is one way to receive proper coaching and guidance through this pro-\ncess. In absence of an experienced trainer, this article presents some basic\nconcepts for scaling workouts particularly for beginners. Scaling for other pop-\nulations (e.g., advanced or injured athletes) is discussed in greater detail at the\nLevel 2 Certificate Course, as well as in the Online Scaling Course.\nAthletes will need to scale workouts for variable lengths of time. One\u2019s athletic\nbackground, as well as his or her current health and fitness capacity, dictates how\nlong scaling is necessary. The methodology presented here can be used indefi-\nnitely, but a month is the minimum period for which significant scaling should be\napplied. This introductory period serves two purposes: 1) it develops competency\nof movements used in CrossFit; and 2) it appropriately exposes the athlete to grad-\nual increases in intensity and volume.\nMECHANICS AND CONSISTENCY FIRST\nCrossFit\u2019s charter for creating the most optimal balance of safety, efficacy, and\nefficiency is: mechanics, consistency, then\u2014and only then\u2014intensity. The initial\nexposure to CrossFit is when movement mechanics should be prioritized over in-\ntensity. And for some, just practicing the movements will be intense. It is impera-\ntive that the movements can be performed correctly and consistently before load\nand speed are added. While intensity is an important part of the CrossFit program,\nit is added after movement proficiency is established. Ignoring this order increas-\nes the risk for injury and potentially blunts long-term progress, especially if poor\nmechanics are combined with load.\nSCALING EFFECTIVELY: PRESERVE THE STIMULUS\nWhen scaling workouts, the main principle to follow is \u201cpreserve the stimulus.\u201d\nThe stimulus of the workout refers to the effects of the specific combination of\nmovements, time domain, and load. Aspects of this combination can be adjusted\nfor each individual so that the workout produces relatively similar effects on each\nathlete\u2014regardless of physical abilities.\nThe breadth of workouts and varying levels of CrossFit beginners make it impos-\nsible to provide a single rule for scaling workouts. Similarly, deviations from the\nguidelines presented herein can be effective choices at times (especially for more\nadvanced athletes). For best results, the individual should use his or her own judg-\nment\u2014or the advice of a qualified trainer\u2014to determine what is appropriate. Ath-\nletes and trainers should not be afraid to alter the workout after it has begun. At\nthe appearance of unsafe form, the athlete or coach should end the workout or\nreduce the load to that which allows proper mechanics.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 77 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nScaling CrossFit, continued\nIntensity and Volume\nTwo factors need to be scaled for every beginner: 1) intensity; and 2) volume. A\nprudent method for beginners is reducing intensity and/or volume by half for at\nleast two weeks. Depending on how the athlete progresses, volume and intensity\ncan be gradually increased in the following weeks, months, and years.\nIntensity refers to the amount of power an athlete generates. Intensity may be\nmodified in three ways: 1) load; 2) speed; and/or 3) volume.\nLoad is the variable to scale first; scaling the load is an easy way to preserve the\nstimulus relative to an athlete\u2019s capacity. Load is also the most common variable\nmodified after the beginner period. Especially for a conditioning workout, the ath-\nlete should use a load that ensures he or she is able to complete the first set or\nround without compromising form or reaching muscular failure. Determining ap-\npropriate loads for newer athletes requires some estimation, and scaling will not\nalways be perfect. Often, loads for newer athletes will be less than 50 percent\nof the prescribed load, especially if an athlete is new to lifting weights. Coaches\nshould err on the side of scaling too much rather than not enough, particularly for\nnewer athletes.\nSpeed tends to be more self-modulated due to the athlete\u2019s fitness level, although\na coach can modulate speed based on the mechanics demonstrated. A coach\nmight have to slow an athlete down to achieve the correct mechanics. Similarly,\ncoaches might have to encourage an athlete who is moving well to move faster,\nthough this is less common when working with beginners (see \u201cTechnique\u201d article).\nVolume is the total amount of work accomplished by the athlete. Depending on\nthe workout, volume can be lowered by reducing: 1) time; 2) reps/rounds; and/or\n3) distance.\nNewer CrossFit athletes might attempt to struggle through a workout where\nthe volume of repetitions (or load, above) is beyond their current capacity. For\nexample, an advanced CrossFit athlete might complete Fran in 2 minutes. That\nsame workout might take a newer athlete 15 minutes or more if completed as\nprescribed. While it is not imperative for beginners to finish in the same time as\nadvanced athletes \u2013 times should be relatively similar. Fran should be completed\nwithin several minutes.\nWhile lowering the volume can increase intensity (i.e., produce more power), vol-\nume reductions are also important for beginners because muscles, ligaments, and\ntendons need to become gradually accustomed to the volume in CrossFit. Reduc-\ning volume also reduces excessive soreness, as well as the risk for rhabdomyoly-\nsis and injury.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 78 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "METHODOLOGY Level 1 Training Guide\nScaling CrossFit, continued\nMovements\nWhen a movement cannot be performed at all, it can be substituted. CrossFit\nsuggests modifying this variable last because avoiding a movement prevents an\nindividual from developing proficiency in it. An athlete or trainer should first try re-\nducing the load before substituting the movement. If the workout calls for snatch-\nes at 95 lb., for example, it is generally preferable that the athlete performs the\nsnatches with a PVC pipe instead of substituting 95-lb. overhead squats.\nComplete movement substitutions should be considered when a physical limita-\ntion or injury is present, or when the load cannot be reduced. When selecting a\nsubstitute movement, trainers should try to preserve the original movement\u2019s\nfunction and range of motion as best they can. When determining movement sub-\nstitutions consider:\n1) Whether the movement is primarily driven by the lower body or\nupper body.\n2) The movement function (e.g., push versus pull).\n3) The range of motion used by the movement (specifically of the hips,\nknees, and ankles).\n4) The plane of movement.\nParticularly in the case of injury, a complete movement replacement might be nec-\nessary. Consideration of these variables can help trainers select a movement sub-\nstitution or replacement that is as similar as possible to the prescribed movement.\nA SAMPLE WEEK OF SCALING\nThis section outlines five typical CrossFit workouts. For each Workout of the Day\n(WOD), scaled workouts are presented with modifications to volume, load, and\nmovements. Some of the rationale for the options is also described. These scaled\nworkouts should be considered but three examples of the many options available.\nThey do not take the place of scaled workouts created by an experienced trainer\nwho is relying on intuition and detailed knowledge of a specific athlete.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 79 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

For example, if the athlete is\nattempting box jumps at a certain height for the first time this can be reduced while keeping the\nwall-ball shots at the prescribed volume.\n\u2022 The box height can be significantly reduced to help preserve the jump. Step-ups could be used to\npreserve the range of motion when capacity does allow for jumps (e.g., injury).\n\u2022 Also consider changing the height to which the wall ball is thrown, particularly when the athlete is\nnew to the movement and/or trying a new weight.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 80 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

For\nexample, a 1-repetition-maximum snatch day may be changed to 3 repetitions.\n\u2022 In rare cases, the range of motion may be shortened until the mechanics are correct. This might\nrequire the barbell to be pulled from pins (or off bumpers), for example.

Push presses (45 lb.)\nPush jerks (75 lb.)\nScaling Considerations\nThe total volume is moderately high (84 reps) and is effectively halved by removing the first two rounds\nof 21 and 18 reps.\n\u2022 The load can be reduced for both movements. As they are more complicated movements for\nbeginners, this is a perfect opportunity to keep the movements as is but lower the load to refine\nthe mechanics.\n\u2022 In rare cases, a push press should be substituted when the mechanics of the push jerk are not\nproficient for significant load or volume.\n\u2022 Substituting a kettlebell for a barbell in the SDHP is a way to reduce the complexity of the\nmovement. It allows the athletes to work on the core-to-extremity movement pattern without\nhaving to navigate a bar around the knees.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 81 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

A medicine ball is\nparticularly useful for the newer athlete.\n\u2022 The muscle-up will need to be scaled, and this is best accomplished with upper-body pulling and\npushing movements, or even a banded version of the full movement itself.\n\u2022 Changing the rep scheme can be useful when the modification significantly challenges the\nindividual\u2019s strength stamina. Doing so will allow the individual to achieve almost the same volume\nwhile he or she develops new skills and/or is exposed to heavier elements.\nCONCLUSION\nAthletes and their trainers should focus on movement proficiency before adding\nspeed and load. Workouts should be scaled significantly for at least a month, par-\nticularly with regard to intensity and volume. The period of scaling workouts\u2014\nespecially load\u2014might continue for months and years as the athlete develops\nthe requisite capacities. With appropriate scaling, an athlete will make significant\nfitness gains by working at his or her relative level of physical and psychologi-\ncal tolerance.\nMost athletes need to modify CrossFit.com workouts to dose themselves ap-\npropriately.

Midline Stabilization Versus Muted Hip.\nWe use a simple iconography to depict the spine, pelvis, femur, and tibia. We show\nthat the spine has a normal \u201cS\u201d shape and we show where it is on the athlete\u2019s\nbody. We similarly demonstrate the pelvis, femur, and tibia (Figure 1).\nWe next demonstrate the motion of three joints. First, the knee is the joint con-\nnecting tibia and femur. Second, working our way up, is the hip. The hip is the joint\nthat connects the femur to the pelvis. Third, is the sacroiliac joint (SI joint), which\nconnects the pelvis to the spine. (We additionally make the point that the spine is\nreally a whole bunch of joints.)\nWe explain that the femur and tibia constitute \u201cthe leg\u201d and that the pelvis and\nspine constitute \u201cthe trunk.\u201d\nThat completes our anatomy lesson\u2013now for the physiology. We demonstrate that\n\u201cflexion\u201d is reducing the angle of a joint and that \u201cextension\u201d is increasing the an-\ngle of a joint.\nBefore covering our distillation of essential biomechanics, we test our students to\nsee if everyone can flex and extend their knee (or \u201cleg\u201d), hip, spine, and sacroiliac\njoint (or \u201ctrunk\u201d) on cue. When it is clear that the difference between flexion and\nextension is understood at each joint, we cue for combinations of behaviors, for\ninstance, \u201cflex one leg and trunk but not your hip\u201d (Figure 2).\nOnce the joints, parts, and movements are clear we offer these three tidbits of\nbiomechanics:\n\u2022 Functional movement generally weds the spine to the pelvis.

In fact, if you do not squat, your\nknees are not healthy regardless of\nhow free of pain or discomfort you are.\nThis is equally true of the hips and back.\nThe squat is no more an invention of a\ncoach or trainer than is the hiccup or\nsneeze. It is a vital, natural, functional\ncomponent of your being.\nThe squat, in the bottom position, is nature\u2019s intended sitting posture (chairs are\nnot part of your biological makeup), and the rise from the bottom to the stand is\nthe biomechanically sound method by which we stand up. There is nothing con-\ntrived or artificial about this movement.\nMost of the world\u2019s inhabitants sit not on chairs but in a squat. Meals, ceremo-\nnies, conversation, gatherings, and defecation are all performed bereft of chairs\nor seats. Only in the industrialized world do we find the need for chairs, couch-\nes, benches, and stools. This comes at a loss of functionality that contributes im-\nmensely to decrepitude.\nFrequently, we encounter individuals whose doctor or chiropractor has told them\nnot to squat. In nearly every instance this is pure ignorance on the part of the\npractitioner. When doctors who do not like the squat are asked, \u201cBy what method\nshould your patient get off the toilet?\u201d they are at a loss for words.\nIn a similarly misinformed manner we have heard trainers and health care provid-\ners suggest that the knee should not be bent past 90 degrees. It is entertaining to\nask proponents of this view to sit on the ground with their legs out in front of them\nand then to stand without bending the legs more than 90 degrees. It cannot be\ndone without some grotesque bit of contrived movement. The truth is that getting\nup off of the floor involves a force on at least one knee that is substantially greater\nthan the squat.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 104 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

Start with the feet about shoulder width apart and 14. In profile, the ear does not move forward during the\nslightly toed out. squat; it travels straight down.\n2. Keep your head up, looking slightly above parallel. 15. Do not let the squat just sink, but pull yourself down\nwith your hip flexors.\n3.

Send your hands as far away from your butt as possible.\nOur presumption is that those who counsel against the squat are either just re-\npeating nonsense they have heard in the media or at the gym, or in their clinical\npractice they have encountered people who have injured themselves squatting\nincorrectly.\nIt is entirely possible to injure yourself squatting incorrectly, but it is also exceed-\ningly easy to bring the squat to a level of safety matched by walking.\nOn the athletic front, the squat is the quintessential hip extension exercise,\nand hip extension is the foundation of all good human movement. Powerful,\ncontrolled hip extension is necessary and nearly sufficient for elite athleticism.\n\u201cNecessary\u201d in that without powerful, controlled hip extension you are not func-\ntioning anywhere near your potential. \u201cSufficient\u201d in the sense that everyone we\nhave met with the capacity to explosively open the hip could also run, jump,\nthrow, and punch with impressive force.\nSecondarily, but no less important, the squat is among those exercises eliciting a\npotent neuroendocrine response.

All Rights Reserved.", "MOVEMENTS Level 1 Training Guide\nSquat Clinic, continued\nTHE AIR SQUAT\nAll our athletes begin their squatting with the \u201cair squat\u201d; that is, without any\nweight other than body weight. As a matter of terminology, when we refer to the\n\u201csquat\u201d we are talking about an unladen, body-weight-only squat. When we wish\nto refer to a weighted squat we will use the term back squat, overhead squat, or\nfront squat, referring to those distinct weighted squats. Training with the front,\nback, and overhead squats before the weightless variant has been mastered re-\ntards athletic potential and compromises safety and efficacy.\nWhen has the squat been mastered? This is a good question. It is fair to say that\nthe squat is mastered when both technique and performance are superior. This\nsuggests that none of the points of performance are deficient and fast multiple\nreps are possible. Our favorite standard for fast multiple reps would be the Ta-\nbata squat (20 seconds on/10 seconds off repeated 8 times) with the weakest of\neight intervals being between 18 and 20 reps. Do not misunderstand \u2014we are\nlooking for 18-20 perfect squats in 20 seconds, rest for 10, and repeat seven\nmore times for a total of eight intervals.\nThe most common faults to look for are surrendering of the lumbar curve at the\nbottom, not breaking the parallel plane with the hips, slouching in the chest and\nshoulders, lifting the heels, and not fully extending the hip at the top (Figure 1).\nDo not even think about weighted squats until none of these faults belong to you.\nA relatively small angle of hip extension, while indicative of a beginner\u2019s or weak\nsquat and caused by weak hips extensors, is not strictly considered a fault as\nlong as the lumbar spine is neutral.\nCAUSES OF A BAD SQUAT\n1) Weak glute/hamstring. The glutes and hams are responsible for powerful\nhip extension, which is the key to the athletic performance universe.\n2) Poor engagement, weak control, and no awareness of glute and\nhamstring. The road to powerful, effective hip extension is a three-to-\nfive-year odyssey for most athletes.\n3) Attempting to squat with quads. Leg extension dominance over hip\nextension is a leading obstacle to elite performance in athletes.\n4) Inflexibility. Tight hamstrings are a powerful contributor to slipping into\nlumbar flexion\u2013the worst fault of all.\n5) Sloppy work, poor focus. This is not going to come out right by accident.\nIt takes incredible effort.

Find balance, let\ngo, repeat closer and higher, etc. This lifts the squat (raises head, chest, shoul-\nders, and torso), putting more load on heels and glute/hams. This immediately\nforces a solid bottom posture from which you have the opportunity to feel the\nforces required to balance in good posture. This is a reasonable shoulder stretch\nbut not as good as the overhead squat.\nBox Squatting: Squat to a 10-inch box, rest at the\nbottom without altering posture, then squeeze\nand rise without rocking forward. Keep a perfect\nposture at the bottom. This is a classic bit of tech-\nnology perfected at the Westside Barbell Club.\nBottom-to-Bottoms: Stay at the bottom, come up\nto full extension, and quickly return to the bottom,\nspending much more time at the bottom than the\ntop; for instance, sitting in the bottom for five min-\nutes, coming up to full extension only once every\nfive seconds (60 reps) (Figure 3).

If shoulders are too tight, this movement will give an instant di-\nagnosis. You can move into a doorway and find where the arms fall and cause the\nstick to bang into the doorway.

There are three common obstacles to learning the overhead squat.\nThe first is the scarcity of skilled instruction\u2014outside the weightlifting community\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 111 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "MOVEMENTS Level 1 Training Guide\nThe Overhead Squat, continued\nmost instruction on the overhead squat is laughably, horribly wrong\u2014dead wrong.\nThe second is a weak squat \u2014you need to have a rock-solid squat to learn the over-\nhead squat. The third obstacle is starting with too much weight\u2013you have not a\nsnowball\u2019s chance in hell of learning the overhead squat with a bar. You will need\nto use a length of dowel or PVC pipe; use anything over 5 lb. to learn this move and\nyour overhead squat will be stillborn.\nLEARNING THE OVERHEAD SQUAT\n1) Start only when you have a strong squat and use a dowel or PVC pipe,\nnot a weight. You should be able to maintain a rock-bottom squat\nwith your back arched, head and eyes forward, and body weight\npredominantly on your heels for several minutes as a prerequisite to the\noverhead squat. Even a 15-lb. training bar is way too heavy to learn the\noverhead squat (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. An Overhead Squat Depends on a Proficient Air Squat.\n2) Learn locked-arm \u201cdislocates\u201d or \u201cpass-throughs\u201d with the dowel. You\nwant to be able to move the dowel nearly 360 degrees, starting with the\ndowel down and at arms\u2019 length in front of your body, and then moving it\nin a wide arc until it comes to rest down and behind you without bending\nyour arms at any point in its travel. Start with a grip wide enough to\neasily pass through, and then repeatedly bring the hands in closer until\npassing through presents a moderate stretch of the shoulders (Figure 2).\nThis is your training grip.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 112 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

Shoulder Dislocates to Determine Grip Width.\n3) Be able to perform the pass-through at the top, the bottom, and\neverywhere in between while descending into the squat. Practice by\nstopping at several points on the path to the bottom, hold, and gently,\nslowly, swing the dowel from front to back, again, with locked arms. At\nthe bottom of each squat, slowly bring the dowel back and forth moving\nfrom front to back (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Shoulder Dislocates Throughout the Overhead Squat Range of Motion.\n4) Learn to find the frontal plane with the dowel from every position in the\nsquat. Practice this with your eyes closed. You want to develop a keen\nsense of where the frontal plane is located. This is the same drill as Step\n3 but this time you are bringing the dowel to a stop in the frontal plane\nand holding briefly with each pass-through (Figure 4). Have a training\npartner check to see if at each stop the dowel is in the frontal plane.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 113 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

Shoulder Dislocates Stopping in the Frontal Plane.\n5) Start the overhead squat by standing tall with the dowel held as high as\npossible in the frontal plane (Figure 5). You want to start with the dowel\ndirectly overhead, not behind you, or, worse yet, even a little bit in front.\nFigure 5. Overhead Position.\n6) Very slowly lower to the bottom of the squat, keeping the dowel in the\nfrontal plane the entire time (Figure 6). Have a training partner watch\nfrom your side to make sure that the dowel does not move forward or\nbackward as you squat to the bottom. Moving slightly behind the frontal\nplane is acceptable, but forward is dead wrong. If you cannot keep the\ndowel from coming forward your grip might be too narrow. The dowel will\nnot stay in the frontal plane automatically; you will have to pull it back very\ndeliberately as you descend (particularly if your chest comes forward).\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 114 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

We can put a 2.5-lb. plate on the dowel, then a 5, then a 5\nand a 2.5, and then a 10. Next use a 15-lb. training bar, but only while\nmaintaining perfect form (Figure 7).

Practicing for this is a superb warm-up and\ncool-down drill and stretch.\nThe overhead squat develops core control by punishing any forward wobble of\nthe load with an enormous and instant increase in the moment about the hip and\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 115 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

When the bar is held perfectly overhead and still, which is nearly impossible,\nthe overhead squat does not present greater load on the hip or back, but moving\ntoo fast, along the wrong line of action, or wiggling can bring even the lightest\nloads down like a house of cards.

Both are safe and easy.

Improving and developing your overhead squat will fix\nfaults not visible in the back and front squat.\nAs your max overhead, back, and front squat each rise, their relative measure re-\nveals much about your developing potential for athletic movement.\nAn average of your max back and front squat is an excellent measure of your core,\nhip, and leg strength. Your max overhead squat is an excellent measure of your\ncore stability and control and ultimately your ability to generate effective and effi-\ncient athletic power.\nYour max overhead squat will always be a fraction of the average of your max\nback and front squat but, ideally, with time, they should converge rather than di-\nverge (Figure 8).\nShould they diverge, you are developing hip and core strength, but your capaci-\nty to efficiently apply power distally is reduced. In athletic pursuits you might be\nprone to injury. Should they converge, you are developing useful strength and\npower that can be successfully applied to athletic movements.\nThe functional application or utility of the overhead squat might not be readily\napparent, but there are many real-world occurrences where objects high enough\nto get under are too heavy or not free enough to be jerked or pressed overhead\nyet can be elevated by first lowering your hips until your arms can be locked and\nthen squatting upward.\nOnce developed, the overhead squat is a thing of beauty\u2013a masterpiece of expres-\nsion in control, stability, balance, efficient power, and utility.

The progression also increasingly\nrelies on the power zone. In the shoulder press, the power zone is used for stabi-\nlization only. In the push press the power zone provides not only stability but also\nthe primary impetus in both the dip and drive. In the push jerk the power zone is\ncalled on for the dip, drive, second dip, and squat. The role of the hip is increased\nin each exercise.\nWith the push press you will be able to drive overhead as much as 30 percent more\nweight than with the shoulder press. The push jerk will allow you to drive as much\nas 30 percent more overhead than you would with the push press.\nIn effect the hip is increasingly recruited through the progression of lifts to assist\nthe arms and shoulders in raising loads overhead. After mastering the push jerk\nyou will find that it will unconsciously displace the push press as your method of\nchoice when going overhead.\nThe second dip on the push jerk will become lower and lower as you both master\nthe technique and increase the load. At some point in your development, the loads\nwill become so substantial that the upper body cannot contribute but a fraction\nto the movement, at which point the catch becomes very low and an increasing\namount of the lift is accomplished by the overhead squat.\nOn both the push press and jerk, the \u201cdip\u201d is critical to the entire movement. The\nstomach is held very tightly and the resultant turnaround from dip to drive is sud-\nden, explosive, and violent.\nTRY THESE\n1) Start with 95 lb. and push press or push jerk 15 straight repetitions, rest\n30 seconds, and repeat for total of 5 sets of 15 repetitions each. Go up\nin weight only when you can complete all 5 sets with only 30 seconds of\nrest between each and do not pause in any set.\n2) Repetition 1: shoulder press, Repetition 2: push press, Repetition 3: push\njerk. Repeat until shoulder press is impossible, then continue until push\npress is impossible, then five more push jerks. Start with 95 lb. and go up\nonly when the total repetitions exceed 30.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 122 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

In profile, there is a ref-\nerence line that trisects the spine and bisects the pelvis. Midline stabilization is\nthe ability to maintain rigidity, stability, and a lack of deflection about that line\n(Figure 1). This translates to improved efficiency and performance and greater\npower output.\nIt is critical to the deadlift, to the laden squat, to the shoulder press, and to any\nsport. In a swimmer\u2019s stroke\u2014when the left leg kicks and right arm pulls\u2014if the\ntorso deviates to one side, you lose energy. Energy is lost in its deflection, wheth-\ner throwing a punch, riding a bicycle, or squatting. The abdominals, with the hip\nflexors, control one side of the torso, with the hip extensors and erectors involved\non the other side.\nHowever, what we have in modern physical culture is an excessive awareness\nand focus on the anterior and not on the posterior. As a culture of athletes and\nnon-athletes alike, we are unfortunately frontally fixated. Pecs\u2014what about the\nrhomboids? Abs\u2014what about the erectors? Quads\u2014what about the glute-ham-\nstring? And for the best of functional movement\u2014punch, jump, throw, run\u2014the\nimpetus comes out of the posterior.\nWe see communities where there is a very deliberate and concerted effort to min-\nimize hip-flexor involvement in exercise. And yet, by insertion and origin, by me-\nchanical position and advantage, and just kinematically, the hip flexors, have\nseveral times the contraction capacity that is estimated of the abdominals. All of it:\nhip extensors, hip flexors, trunk flexors, and ex-\ntensors are essential to midline stabilization. The\nabdominals are just one part of the story.\nFor core strength (midline stabilization), we are\ntalking about static control. We do not want this\nrelationship of spine to pelvis deflecting. Never-\ntheless, a lot of the commonly used \u201ccore\u201d move-\nments involve dynamic movements: the crunch\nis a very deliberate flexion of the trunk.

Static contractions for midline stabilization are the\nbest ab exercises known. No amount of crunches are ever going to get you to the\nsame end point as the L-sit, overhead squat, deadlift, etc.\nWhat we suspect is that if you could sequentially fire the abs with the same force\nin any kind of dynamic pattern, you would have the ability to seriously injure your\nspine. If you could ever crunch with the same force that you can stabilize, you\nwould be able to break your back at will. We have come hardwired unable to do\nthat\u2014that is my guess.\nThe movements are presented in the order in which they should be developed in\na client. The first thing is a simple hip extension: articulate at the hip only, maintain-\ning the distance from xiphoid process to pubic bone. There is no shortening of the\ntrunk. There is no trunk flexion,\njust hip extension and flexion\nwhile maintaining midline sta-\nbilization. The erectors are be-\ning used statically, and the\nprimary movers here are glu-\ntes and hamstrings working\nconcentrically and eccentrical-\nly.

Using those\nmuscles is essential for midline stabilization and working the posterior.\nThe fourth movement on the GHD is a sit-up but involves no trunk flexion. For the\nGHD sit-up, the pad is set so that the pelvis is free, and the athlete descends back\nto touch the ground and then comes back to seated. More than a few exercise\nphysiologists and certified trainers have observed that this movement is pure hip\nflexion and consequently asserted \u201cthere\u2019s no abs in that.\u201d\nBut what the abs are doing in this exercise is midline stabilization.\nBefore having clients perform the GHD sit-up, ensure they have demonstrated ca-\npacity in the hip extension, back extension, and hip-and-back extension. Even still,\ntheir first GHD sit-ups should be performed in a shortened range of motion, with\nthe trainer spotting behind them (Figure 6). That might be it for the first dose. Once\nthey come back and you can determine the effect from that dose, increase the\nrange of motion and volume as their capacity allows.\nTo perform a GHD sit-up, there is some leg flexion in the descent. Then, the leg\nextends dramatically and pulls the athlete to seated (Figure 7). Conversely, if the\nathlete does not extend the leg to come to seated, the primary movers are the hip\nflexors, but specifically the psoas.\nThe psoas comes off the femur, runs through the pelvis (without attachment) and\nattaches to the lumbar spine. The hip flexors also include a very powerful comple-\nment to the psoas: the rectus femoris, which is the dominant piece of the quad-\nriceps. The rectus femoris does not attach to the lumbar spine, but it attaches to\nthe pelvis. This attachment to the pelvis is a point of enormous mechanical advan-\ntage and leverage. And to fully engage that, the leg must extend dramatically. The\nleg cannot sharply extend without working rectus femoris\u2014a leg extensor and\na hip flexor.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 139 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "MOVEMENTS Level 1 Training Guide\nThe Glute-Ham Developer (GHD), continued\nThe force with which an athlete comes up is amazing. Rather than being pulled\nfrom the psoas alone, which is a fairly dysfunctional kind of pull, the athlete uses\nthe full complement of hip-flexor musculature. Any time you are using a fraction of\nthe primary movers responsible for that articulation, it is not natural, not function-\nal, and contrary to nature. Not extending the leg can also be a little irritating to the\nlow back due to this shearing force on the lumbar spine. Performed correctly, the\nmovement is not irritating to the low back. Straightening that leg enables profound\nmusculature to lift from the pelvis.\nThere are people who have this irritation in the spine from a shear force. If you can\nteach them to extend the legs to work the full complement of hip flexors, we will\nmove the margins where this irritation occurs from 3 reps to 4 reps to 10 reps and\nso on. That is rehabilitation. That is neuromuscular re-education.\nThere is an adjunct movement to GHD sit-up in which the athlete is dynamic in the\ntrunk and static in the hip. It is the AbMat sit-up, where we deliberately take the\nhip flexors out of the equation and work the torso dynamically. The hip flexors are\nworking statically or possibly to no significant degree.\nTo do this, the hip flexors need to be removed from the line of action. The fat part\nof the AbMat goes toward the glutes, and the athlete puts the bottom of his or her\nsoles together with the knees butterflied. This positioning makes the hip flexors\ntangential to the line of action; i.e., they cannot do any productive work. This is\ndone deliberately. Then the athlete slowly and under control comes to seated by\ncontracting the abdominals. This is a very dynamic bit of trunk flexion and the hip\nflexors are removed (Figure 8).\nAs the athlete fails, adduct and extend the legs to some degree. This creates more\npurchase for the hip flexors and brings them into the line of action. This allows the\nathlete to modulate the assistance and keep each rep focused on the midsection.\nIf reps are performed slowly and deliberately, most athletes will fail a sit-up with-\nout an AbMat. The failure is not necessarily a neuromuscular failure. It is not\nnecessarily a weakness or deficiency. The truth is the movement is defective mi-\nnus the AbMat.\nWithout an AbMat, the athlete has a solid point of contact below the upper back.\nTo move, I need to act off of something immovable. When the athlete gets full con-\ntraction of the rectus, the lower back actually goes flat. This is not enough to bring\nhim up to seated. When this space between the low back and the floor is filled with\nsomething to act against (like the AbMat), the athlete can curl to seated.\nThere is a very short range of motion available in lumbar flexion to protect the\nspine.

But that lum-\nbar region is fairly inflexible, and all that range of motion that is available moves\none from spinally extended through to neutral. There is no more shortening or\nflexion to it; it is not enough to sit up.\nWithout the AbMat, the sit-up is a biphasic movement. While I have solid contact,\nI use upper rectus and create enough momentum to throw the load to the hip\nflexors, where I have more connection. This means that the full rectus has little\nstimulus\u2014it is pulling me from spinally extended through to neutral, but absent\nof any load. The upper rectus is worked where there is a fulcrum, so the back flat-\ntens, but it is the hip flexors that pull me to seated. There is no amount of sit-ups\nyou can do on the ground that is ever going to work you from pubic bone to about\n3 or 4 inches above the belly button. The AbMat moves the athlete from spinally\nextended through to neutral in the lumbar spine against a load.\nHow big would your bench press get if you only pushed air? You would get as\nstrong as your abs will with a ground-based sit-up. With or without the pad, there\nis the same contraction and range of motion in the midsection. Without the pad,\nthe fibers shortened but there was no load and no real work completed. With the\npad, they got the same motion but under a load, and it produced fruitful work.\nThe two sit-ups, GHD and AbMat, complement each other beautifully. One is dy-\nnamic in the hips and static in the trunk; the other is dynamic in the trunk and stat-\nic in the hip. In conjunction with the L-sit (static in the trunk and hip), they develop\na formidable capacity in the midline.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 141 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

To maintain the credential, trainers must retake the\ncourse every five years (or sooner) or pursue higher-level CrossFit credentials.\nThe Level 1 Course is an effective, broad survey of CrossFit\u2019s foundational meth-\nodology and movements, and earning the Level 1 Certificate should be considered\nthe first step for training others. The purpose of this article is to provide guidance\nfor additional professional development of new CrossFit trainers. The article is di-\nvided into three sections:\n1) How to Be an Effective Trainer.\n2) How to Develop as a Trainer.\n3) How to Train Others While Gaining Experience.\nThe term \u201cvirtuosity\u201d\u2014doing the common uncommonly well\u2014can be used to de-\nscribe the mastery of movement technique that CrossFit athletes seek to achieve.\nChasing virtuosity can also describe the path to coaching mastery. Master coaches\ndisplay an unmatched capacity to improve others\u2019 fitness. True mastery demands\na lifetime commitment to improvement of craft; those looking for mastery never\nconsider their development complete.\nHOW TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TRAINER\nAn effective trainer must have capacity in six different abilities:\n\u2022 Teaching.\n\u2022 Seeing.\n\u2022 Correcting.\n\u2022 Group and/or gym management.\n\u2022 Presence and attitude.\n\u2022 Demonstration.\nThis list can be viewed as similar in principle to the list of 10 general physical skills\nfor fitness outlined in \u201cWhat is Fitness? (Part 1).\u201d Athletes with capacity in each of\nthe 10 skills are considered fitter than athletes who demonstrate excessive ca-\npacity in any one skill to a detriment of capacity in the others. Similarly, effective\ntrainers demonstrate capacity in each of the six abilities listed above, not just one\nor two. The more effective the trainer, the greater his or her capacity in each abil-\nity. These six areas are the focus of study and practical application at the Level 2\nCertificate Course.\n1. Teaching\u2014The ability to effectively articulate and teach the mechanics\nof each movement. This includes the ability to focus on major points\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 142 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nWhere Do I Go From Here, continued\nof performance before more subtle or nuanced ones and the ability to\nchange instruction based on the athlete\u2019s needs and capacity.\nA trainer\u2019s ability to teach others reflects his or her knowledge as well as the ability\nto effectively communicate that knowledge. To communicate knowledge to oth-\ners, a coach must understand what defines proper mechanics and what causes\nbad or inefficient movement. This requires continual study, and one\u2019s teaching will\nimprove with greater understanding in all fields that intersect with fitness.\nAn effective teacher also has a unique ability to relate to every student, regardless\nof his or her background and ability. This requires the teacher to distill a large body\nof knowledge to a single point or a few salient points specific to the current need\nof the athlete and the movement being taught. An effective teacher also takes\nownership for recognizing when communication between the teacher and athlete\nbreaks down. Generally, the more forms of communication a teacher employs\n(verbal, visual, tactile, use of different examples/ analogies, etc.), the more likely\nthe athlete will find success in training.\n2. Seeing\u2014The ability to discern good from poor movement mechanics\nand to identify both gross and subtle faults whether the athlete is in\nmotion or static.\nAn effective trainer demonstrates the ability to see movement and determine\nwhether the mechanics are sound or unsound. This ability first requires knowl-\nedge of when to observe and evaluate very specific aspects of the athlete\u2019s move-\nment (e.g., trunk-to-femur relationship for hip extension, center of pressure on\nfeet for posterior-chain engagement). It also requires knowledge of the differences\nbetween good and poor positions. An effective trainer can see faults both when\nthe athlete is moving (e.g., hip extension) and not moving (e.g., the receiving posi-\ntion of a clean). Newer coaches tend to have the greatest difficulty spotting move-\nment faults while athletes are moving.\n3. Correcting\u2014The ability to facilitate better mechanics for an athlete\nusing visual, verbal, and/or tactile cues. This includes the ability to triage\n(prioritize) faults in order of importance, which includes an understanding\nof how multiple faults are related.\nOnce a trainer can teach the movements and see faults, he or she is then able to\ncorrect the athlete. Effective correction makes an athlete\u2019s mechanics better. Cor-\nrecting hinges on the trainer\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022 Use successful cues.\n\u2022 Know multiple corrections for each fault.\n\u2022 Triage faulty movement.\n\u2022 Balance critique with praise.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 143 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nWhere Do I Go From Here, continued\nAny cue that results in improved movement mechanics is successful and therefore\na \u201cgood\u201d cue. There are no specific formulas, formats or rules to follow for cues,\nand their value is based on the result.\nHowever, short, specific and actionable cues \u2013 \u201cpush the hips back\u201d \u2013 tend to result\nin a greater success rate. A trainer needs multiple strategies for each fault because\ndifferent clients often respond to the same cue in a different manner.\nWhen multiple faults occur at once, a trainer is best served by attacking them one\nat a time in order of importance (i.e., triaging). The ordering is based on the se-\nverity of the deviation from ideal and the athlete\u2019s capacity relative to the task; no\nsingle ordering of faults can be used across all athletes and movements. Through-\nout the cueing process, a trainer needs to celebrate small changes or even just\ncelebrate hard work to build rapport and acknowledge a client\u2019s effort even when\nthose efforts are not immediately successful.\nNewer trainers tend to be lacking in their ability to see and correct movement.\nWhen coaching others, trainers need to focus on movement. Good coaches re-\nlentlessly watch movement with a critical eye. Good coaches are constantly ask-\ning the following questions: How could an individual be more efficient and safe?\nWhat cues would result in a better position? How can cues be delivered to produce\nthe best response from the athlete? Good coaches produce noticeable changes in\ntheir athletes\u2019 movement. To develop this critical eye, coaches can work with great\ntrainers, film themselves or other athletes, or film classes.\n4. Group Management\u2014The ability to organize and manage, both at\na micro level (within each class) and at the macro gym level. This\nincludes managing time well; organization of the space, equipment, and\nparticipants for optimal flow and experience; planning ahead; etc.\nGroup management speaks to the trainer\u2019s ability to reduce the logistical set-up\nand preparation time during a class to maximize the amount of teaching and\nmovement time. This means the trainer plans the instruction ahead of time (see\n\u201cRunning a CrossFit Class\u201d article) and perhaps pre-arranges the equipment and/\nor weights to avoid excessive talking at the expense of moving.\nPractice time in every class is necessary for both the trainer and client. Practice\ntime gives the trainer time to observe and cue movement mechanics, and it gives\nthe client time to work on movement with improved form. Every student should\nfeel he or she received personal coaching within the group atmosphere. Regard-\nless of each athlete\u2019s experience, trainers should make an honest assessment of\nthe time and attention given to each client after each training session. The goal is\nto maximize a trainer\u2019s effectiveness and reach.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 144 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

The trainer shows empathy for athletes and\ncreates rapport.\nAlthough presence and attitude are more intangible than the other criteria, cli-\nents immediately feel their absence. \u201cPositive\u201d should not be interpreted as fake\nor forced. A trainer should be authentic, with a goal of creating a positive training\nexperience for clients.

A commitment to improving each area is the hallmark of a successful\ntrainer, regardless of the trainer\u2019s current level of proficiency. Just as the athlete\nmust refine and improve movement mechanics, a trainer must refine coaching\nskills across a career to become great. Doing so develops virtuosity in coaching.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 145 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nWhere Do I Go From Here, continued\nHOW TO DEVELOP AS A TRAINER\nTo keep up with athletes\u2019 progress, a coach must continue to refine and develop\nhis or her knowledge. If a trainer\u2019s clients are not testing the limits of his or her\nknowledge, the trainer is not doing a good enough job with them. An expert coach\nis eager and proud to have a student exceed his or her abilities but seeks to delay\nit by staying ahead of the athlete\u2019s needs rather than by retarding the athlete\u2019s\ngrowth. Coaches should focus on development in both academic and practical\nenvironments.\nHere are some suggestions for how trainers can develop:\n1) First and foremost, teach to learn. It is only through experience that\na trainer will learn and gain competency. It is imperative to work with\npeople in a dynamic environment, even if they are friends or family\nin the beginning. Understanding biochemistry, anatomy and teaching\nmethodologies is important and supportive of this endeavor, but it is not\nenough to allow a trainer to apply knowledge in real time.\n2) Watch more experienced coaches\u2014regardless of their specific discipline.\nWatch what they watch and when they watch for it. Listen to their cues.\nThe best coaches often need very few words to produce noticeable\nimprovement in mechanics. Also watch their rapport with clients. What\ndraws clients to them?\n3) Film yourself coaching others. This can also help with your ability to see\nand correct movement faults as you have the luxury of slowing down the\nfootage. Be critical of yourself and use the six criteria detailed above to\nassess strengths and areas for improvement.\n4) Attend a Level 2 Certificate Course (L2). The L2 allows trainers to work\non their coaching (specifically seeing and correcting movement) in the\npresence of their peers. Where the Level 1 Course is important for\nunderstanding the conceptual framework of CrossFit, the goal of the\nL2 is to improve one\u2019s coaching skill set. The course is designed to give\ntrainers practical feedback based on the six qualities of an effective\ntrainer. It also provides practical drills for trainers to improve specific\ncoaching areas.\n5) Attend additional courses. Specialty teaching methods might differ\nfrom the general information provided in the Level 1 Course. Instead\nof focusing on the differences in methods, focus on understanding the\nconcepts of how and why differing methodologies are appropriate for\ndifferent applications.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 146 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

Un-\nder its Certification branch, CrossFit offers courses on topics such as anat-\nomy and physiology and best business practices. Those pursing advanced\ncredentials in CrossFit may use these courses for required continuing-edu-\ncation credits, but the courses are open to anyone.\n6) Read and study everything related to training, movement and health.\n7) Study and follow CrossFit.com. The archives (since 2001) contain years\nof original CrossFit programming. It is a great resource for learning\nand experimenting with workouts. We challenge all trainers to follow\nCrossFit.com programming for at least six months to understand well-\nvaried and challenging CrossFit programming. It provides a good model\nfor the type of workouts, the variance and the volume (i.e., one workout\na day) required for long-term results. It will also provide experience\non how to scale appropriately, as only the most advanced athletes can\ncomplete all CrossFit.com workouts as prescribed (Rx\u2019d).\n8) Pursue higher credentials, such as CrossFit Level 2 Trainer, Certified\nCrossFit Trainer (Level 3) and Certified CrossFit Coach (Level 4). More\ninformation about the Level 2 credential can be found on CrossFit.com/\ncertificate-courses, and more information about the certifications can\nbe found on CrossFit.com/certifications. The CrossFit Level 4 Coach\ncredential is the preeminent trainer designation offered by CrossFit. This\nevaluation provides distinction for expert coaches within the community.\nHOW TO TRAIN OTHERS WHILE GAINING EXPERTISE\nExpert training comes from years of experience and study long after the comple-\ntion of the Level 1 Certificate Course. However, a novice or less experienced person\ncan still train others. Three important principles should guide trainers at all levels:\n\u2022 Master the fundamentals.\n\u2022 Limit the scope.\n\u2022 Pursue excellence.\nMaster the Fundamentals\nNew athletes are most successful when adhering to the charter of mechanics, con-\nsistency and then intensity. Coaches often manage the time frame in which clients\nreach high levels of intensity. A trainer should not be fooled into thinking new cli-\nents need overly complex movements and high-volume workouts to be \u201csold\u201d on\nhis or her services. Coach Glassman wrote specifically about this in the 2005 arti-\ncle \u201cFundamentals, Virtuosity, and Mastery: An Open Letter to CrossFit Trainers.\u201d\nTrainers need to take time teaching clients proper mechanics and ensuring they\nmove correctly before high levels of intensity are applied. Insist on consistent-\nly safe and correct mechanics, then very gradually increase load and volume\u2014\nwatching closely for movement faults. Not only does this decrease the risk for\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 147 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nWhere Do I Go From Here, continued\ninjury, but it also sets athletes up for greater success in the long term: Efficient and\nsound mechanics allow ever-increasing speeds and loads. These guidelines enable\ntrainers to learn and gain experience while safeguarding the health and well-being\nof people in their care.\nApplying intensity at either end of the spectrum\u2013too much too soon or too little/\nnone at all\u2013blunts the overall benefit from the program. Pushing one\u2019s limits drives\nnew adaptation, and this cannot happen without intensity. On the other hand,\npushing too hard too soon can result in long-term inefficiencies or injury. When\nthe trainer is in doubt, it is better to err on the side of caution and progress slow-\nly. Even at low intensity, many participants see benefits simply from performing\nvaried functional movements, and it will become clear over time when intensity\ncan be added.\nLimit the Scope\nMany CrossFit affiliates follow a group-class model, which can be difficult for a\nnovice coach. The demands of teaching and class management often take the\nattention away from seeing and correcting movement. New trainers are encour-\naged to coach friends and family in individual or small group sessions (two or\nthree athletes) to perfect their ability to improve mechanics before taking on large\ngroup classes. Another option is to assist a head coach for classes and small-group\ntraining. The new trainer can improve his or her ability to discern poor move-\nment and cue good movement, while the head trainer addresses the other logis-\ntics. New trainers should seek out internships or assistant roles at local affiliates\nto gain this experience. A trainer needs to increase the size of classes gradually\nto continually deliver quality training, as Coach Glassman articulated in 2006 in\n\u201cScaling Professional Training\u201d:\n\u201cTo run group classes without compromising our hallmark laser fo-\ncus and commitment to the athlete, the trainer has to learn to give\neach member of the group the impression that he is getting all the\nattention that he could get in one-on-one training, and that requires\ntremendous training skill. We\u2019ve seen this skill fully and adequately\ndeveloped by only one path\u2013gradually migrating from one-on-one\nto group sessions. \u2026 There\u2019s no way a new trainer can walk into this\nenvironment and do well.\u201d\nBeyond the demands of running one quality class is the demand of delivering\nthat quality training for multiple sessions a day. As Coach Glassman wrote when\ntraining in Santa Cruz, California: \u201cFive appointments per day is about all we could\nhandle without an unacceptable drop in energy, focus, and, consequently, profes-\nsional standards.\u201d\nLimiting the scope also means trainers should have the clarity and self-awareness\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 148 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nWhere Do I Go From Here, continued\nto admit when they do not know something. Whether it is a question regarding\nanatomy in the squat, why someone has back pain or why excess sugar can com-\npromise health, it is not wise to try to make up information when an issue is be-\nyond the current level of knowledge or scope of practice. Working only within the\nlimits of one\u2019s knowledge will help protect the safety of clients and build credibil-\nity. A trainer cannot be expected to know all things related to health and fitness.\nDevelop and foster a community of other professionals clients can be referred to\nwith confidence when necessary. Seek to learn the answers to any questions, and\nin the case of any medical condition, the trainer should always refer the client to\na physician.\nPursue Excellence\nTo be a successful trainer (or affiliate), CrossFit\u2019s recommended \u201cbusiness model\u201d\nis the relentless and continual pursuit of excellence. Pursuing excellence was the\nguiding tenet from the early days of the original CrossFit gym in Santa Cruz, and\nthe concept continues to guide larger decisions related to CrossFit.com and the\nLevel 1 Certificate Course, for example. The overarching purpose is to bring more\nquality training to more people. Rather than devising a business model in the pur-\nsuit of money, devise one that is focused on making the training (and, by exten-\nsion, the clients) better. The most effective business plan comes from achieving\nexcellence and letting the market bring the money to you.\nTo pursue excellence, ask the question, \u201cWhat would make the training or the af-\nfiliate better?\u201d An analysis of pros and cons can muddle every decision, and most\nissues can be decided by a simple question: \u201cWill it improve the quality of the pro-\ngramming or the training experience?\u201d If the answer is \u201cYes!\u201d you are most likely\npursuing excellence.\nCROSSFIT COMMUNITY AND REPRESENTATION\nThe Level 1 Certificate Course is a great way to formalize one\u2019s involvement in\nthe CrossFit community. It provides the conceptual framework of the program. It\nalso serves to transmit the community\u2019s ethos: a sense of camaraderie and sup-\nport among like-minded individuals who are humble, hard-working and commit-\nted to service.\nAlong with our affiliates, those who become Level 1 Trainers are the community\u2019s\nmost important ambassadors. The CF-L1 credential is the first step toward affilia-\ntion; more information on that process can be found on CrossFit.com. The global\ncommunity is more than 13,000 affiliates strong. Whether working at an existing\naffiliate or opening a new affiliate, each CrossFit trainer can positively influence\nlives every day.

However, client safety\nalso includes multiple logistical factors, such as programming, specific needs for\nspecial populations, equipment layout and accurate representation of one\u2019s cre-\ndentials. This article is meant to prime new Level 1 Trainers to responsibly train\nothers while gaining expertise.\nMITIGATE CLIENTS\u2019 RISK OF RHABDOMYOLYSIS\nRhabdomyolysis, while rare, can develop from high-intensity or high-volume exer-\ncise, including CrossFit or any other process that damages muscle cells. Rhabdo-\nmyolysis (often simply referred to as \u201crhabdo\u201d) is a medical condition that might\narise from breakdown of muscle tissue and release of the muscle cells\u2019 contents\ninto the bloodstream. This process can damage the kidneys and can lead to renal\nfailure or death in rare cases. Rhabdo is diagnosed when a patient with an appro-\npriate history has an elevated level of creatine kinase, also known as CK or CPK.\nCPK is easier to measure in the blood than myoglobin and is generally used as a\nmarker for rhabdo, even though it is the myoglobin that does the damage.\nTreatment consists of generous amounts of intravenous (IV) fluids to dilute and\nflush the myoglobin through the kidneys. In the worst cases, patients might need\ndialysis while the kidneys recover. Death, though rare, can result when kidney fail-\nure causes imbalances in the usual electrolytes, which can cause cardiac arrhyth-\nmias. Most patients make a complete recovery after being rehydrated with IV fluids\nover anywhere from several hours to a week or so, depending on the severity.\nThere are a few ways a CrossFit trainer can protect athletes from rhabdomyolysis:\n\u2022 Follow the charter of mechanics, consistency, intensity.\n\u2022 Know the movements that have a higher rate of rhabdomyolysis incidence\n(those that prolong the eccentric contraction), and be mindful of the total\nvolume that is programmed with these exercises.\n\u2022 Scale workouts for clients appropriately.\n\u2022 Avoid progressive scaling.\n\u2022 Educate clients on the symptoms of rhabdomyolysis and when it is\nappropriate to seek medical attention.\nFollowing the mechanics-consistency-intensity charter best prepares the athlete\nfor long-term success, but it is also a way to mitigate the potential of developing\nrhabdomyolysis (and other injuries). Slow and gradual increases in intensity and\nvolume allow the body to acclimate to high-intensity and higher-volume exercise.\nEven athletes who quickly demonstrate sound mechanics still need a gradual in-\ncrease in intensity and volume. When working with new athletes, trainers should\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 151 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nResponsible Training, continued\nfocus on using modest loads, reducing volume and coaching the athlete on tech-\nnique. At affiliates where there are \u201celements\u201d or \u201con-ramp\u201d classes that last a\ncouple of weeks, athletes should still be heavily scaled beyond this introductory\nperiod to ensure adequate time to acclimate to CrossFit training. If there are no\nseparate classes for beginners, treat the workouts as technique sessions for new-\ner athletes\u2013focus on their mechanics rather than speed or load. There is no set\nprotocol for how quickly to increase intensity, but it is wise to err on the side of\ncaution and work toward long-term fitness. Multiple months at scaled loads and\nvolumes are well within a normal timeframe for even the best athletes, with gradu-\nal increases in intensity implemented after that. Trainers need to frequently check\nin with athletes to determine how the previous dose of exercise affected them.\nAlthough intensity is a significant part of CrossFit, each athlete has his or her entire\nlife to continue to improve fitness and tolerance for intensity.\nThe second way to mitigate the risk of rhabdomyolysis is to know the movements\nassociated with a higher rate of incidence. Beginner athletes should keep \u201cnega-\ntives\u201d (movements which prolong the eccentric phase) to a minimum. Although\nnegatives can be an effective way to increase strength, they should not be used\nin high volumes with beginners. Athletes may increase the volume of negatives\ngradually over time.\nWhile the eccentric phase of movements cannot and should not be avoided, there\nare movements in which people are more likely to prolong the eccentric phase. In\nCrossFit, these tend to be jumping pull-ups and full-range-of-motion glute-ham de-\nveloper (GHD) sit-ups. In the jumping pull-up, the athlete should not prolong the\ndescent but should instead immediately drop to an extended-arm position once\nthe chin has cleared the bar, absorbing the impact with the legs. Similarly, in the\nfull-range-of-motion GHD sit-up, newer athletes should use fewer repetitions and\npotentially a shortened range of motion until capacity is developed. It is also prudent\nfor trainers to scale the number of repetitions and the range of motion for athletes\nwho do not routinely use GHD sit-ups regardless of their CrossFit experience. There\nare no exact rules for total volume, but beginners and new CrossFit athletes (and\neven advanced CrossFit athletes who have not been routinely using the GHD) should\nstart with relatively low repetitions of the partial-range-of-motion GHD sit-up (i.e., to\nparallel) and gradually increase from there with consistent exposure.\nProgressive scaling\u2013the practice of continually adjusting the difficulty of a workout\nso that an exhausted athlete can keep moving\u2013must be avoided with the beginner\nor even intermediate athlete. Allow these athletes to stop and take rest as needed to\ncomplete the workout. An example: A trainer keeps lowering the load so the athlete\ndoes not have to stop completing reps (e.g., 135-lb. barbell for thrusters dropped to\n115 to 95 to 65 to 45 across the workout duration). Progressive scaling may be used,\nbut it must be applied very cautiously even with the most advanced of athletes.\nIt is also wise to educate athletes about the potential risk for rhabdomyolysis,\nstrategies to reduce the risk and the symptoms. This will help them understand\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 152 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nResponsible Training, continued\nthe rationale for scaling their workouts, especially when they are zealous to per-\nform a workout \u201cas prescribed\u201d (\u201cRx\u2019d\u201d).\nAlcohol and drug use increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis, and athletes should\navoid heavy drinking, especially in proximity to training. Certain medications, in-\ncluding statins (cholesterol-lowering agents), increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis.\nSymptoms of rhabdomyolysis include severe generalized muscle pain, nausea\nand vomiting, abdominal cramping, and, in severe cases, dark-red or cola-colored\nurine. The discoloration of the urine comes from the muscle\u2019s myoglobin, which is\nthe same molecule that gives red meat its color. If these symptoms appear follow-\ning a workout (or at any time with regard to dark-red urine), the athlete should seek\nmedical attention immediately.\nThe athletes at highest risk seem to be those with a reasonable baseline level of\nfitness obtained through some non-CrossFit training, those who are returning to\nCrossFit after a layoff, or even experienced CrossFit athletes who reach volume\nor intensity significantly outside their established \u201cnorm.\u201d These athletes have\nsufficient muscle mass and conditioning to create enough intensity to hurt them-\nselves. Generally, the most deconditioned seem to be at less risk (but not zero). It\nis suspected they do not have enough muscle mass or the capacity to generate\nhigh levels of intensity. This being said, trainers must properly scale and focus on\nmechanics with every client regardless of current capacity.\nMINIMIZE EQUIPMENT- AND SPOTTING-RELATED INJURIES\nBeyond following the charter of mechanics, consistency, and intensity, affiliate\nowners can further minimize risk of injury within their gym. Very real risks exist\nfrom equipment condition, use, and arrangement, as well as from improper spot-\nting of athletes during movements.\nEquipment condition refers both to installation and day-to-day maintenance. In-\nstallation often applies to building pull-up rigs, hanging gymnastics rings, assem-\nbling a GHD, among other things. Professional assistance should be used when an\nowner is inexperienced.\nPull-up-bar rigs and gymnastic rings and associated straps should be designed to\nbear a load far higher than the expected maximum weight to be supported. These\nstructures need to be tested at maximum loading before regular client use.\nRegularly scheduled maintenance of all equipment is paramount. Equipment that\nplaces the athlete\u2019s feet off the ground or inverts the athlete requires extra time\nand attention. Support pieces like straps, racks or bars and locking mechanisms\nneed to be kept in working order and checked regularly for routine wear. Some\nmight become compromised during use. Where there is a risk for handles or col-\nlars to come apart, dumbbells, kettlebells, and even barbells need to be inspected\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 153 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nResponsible Training, continued\nregularly for integrity. Trainers must repair, replace, and discontinue use of faulty\nequipment immediately.\nArrangement refers to the layout of equipment and athletes during a class or\nworkout. Each athlete needs enough space to perform the movements, with an\nadditional buffer to account for the errant-moving equipment, missed attempts,\nand safe passage of coaches or other athletes. Under no circumstances should a\ntrainer permit extra equipment like bars, plates, boxes, etc. to be left lying around\nthe workout area. This equipment might trip athletes or cause a ricochet if other\nequipment lands on it.\nIt is also imperative for a trainer to prepare for falls during dynamic movements. It is\npossible that an athlete might lose his or her grip during a kip (pull-up or muscle-up).\nTrainers might encourage athletes to wrap their thumbs around any bar in an ef-\nfort to provide additional feedback to the athlete. This is not foolproof, however,\nand can sometimes be even less secure, particularly for athletes with small hands.\nWhatever the hand position chosen, it does not replace the need for the athlete to\ndevelop body awareness of when to end the movement if his or her grip is compro-\nmised (wrapping thumbs is always recommended for barbell and ring movements\nto help provide better balance and control, especially in higher-risk scenarios such\nas a bench press or muscle-up). Boxes and racks should not be beneath, behind or\ndirectly in front of these athletes. Adjustable rings should be lowered to the appro-\npriate height. Where assistance boxes are necessary, they are best placed to the side\nof the working athlete (and not in another athlete\u2019s way) to leave a clear path should\nan athlete leave the apparatus prematurely. A suggestion for trainers trying to man-\nage these risks is to do a \u201cdry run\u201d of the workout before it begins: check the working\nspace for each athlete for each of the proposed movements. This can be as simple as\norganizing the class to rotate stations on the trainer\u2019s call and perform a quick walk-\nthrough to check spacing and arrangement. Trainers can then instruct participants\nto move to the same spot during the workout to ensure safety.\nAthletes also need instruction regarding how to bail safely from lifts and how to\nspot other athletes where appropriate. In most weightlifting movements, the ath-\nletes only need to learn how to bail safely. Trainers need to teach athletes this skill\nand allow them to practice it before any significant load is lifted. Trainers should\nalso ensure enough empty space exists around a working athlete so a missed lift\ndoes not have a ricochet effect, as mentioned above. Spotting is not recommend-\ned for weightlifting movements, except for a bench press (where it is mandatory)\nand potentially a back squat (especially where a low-bar position is used). A trainer\ncannot assume athletes understand how to spot correctly, and again, instruction\nand practice at lighter loads are necessary.\nExperienced trainers or athletes may also provide a spot for gymnastics move-\nments. Trainers or athletes should employ a spot that minimizes risk to both spot-\nter and athlete. Generally, gymnastics movements are spotted at the torso or hips\nto provide adequate support for the movement, but spotting at the hips or legs\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 154 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nResponsible Training, continued\ncan be successful (e.g., handstands). The spotter may be to the rear of the athlete\nif the risk of getting hit is low (e.g., ring support, GHD sit-up), but often a position\nbeside the athlete is best (e.g., handstand).\nTrainers need to be sure equipment is cleaned regularly to reduce the chance of\ninfection, and proper disinfectants and sterilizers, with clean cloths, should be\nstaged near the gym floor to clean blood off bars immediately. A blood-spill clean-\nup procedure can be found in the CrossFit Journal archives.\nMONITORING ATHLETES FOR CONDITIONS THAT NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION\nAlthough a trainer is primarily there to instruct and improve athlete movements,\nhe or she needs to monitor the level of exertion during the workout and ensure\nathlete health is protected. As CrossFit workouts use relatively high intensity, ath-\nletes are working at their physical and psychological tolerances. It is possible for\nathletes to push too hard, and confounding environmental factors might exacer-\nbate certain situations.\nExtreme temperature fluctuations, especially heat, can be problematic. Trainers\nshould be ready in unseasonably hot and humid weather with sufficient water, and\nthey should watch for common signs of overexertion (e.g., dizziness). Hot weather\nalso increases the potential risk for rhabdomyolysis (although some cases have\noccurred in cold climates), and trainers should encourage athletes to stay hydrated\n(with the caveat that they should not be excessively hydrated. Current mainstream\nliterature suggests rates of 1.2 L/hour, which are actually too high and can lead to\noverhydration). In the event of a potential heat stroke following a workout (e.g.,\nathlete demonstrates an altered mental state), a trainer should remove excess\nclothing from the athlete and then douse him or her with cool water before med-\nical attention arrives.\nWeather aside, other conditions might need medical attention. Symptoms such\nas numbness or chronic pain in joints and muscles should be referred to medical\nprofessionals. Medical attention is immediately necessary for any non-respon-\nsive athlete.\nTrainers can be best prepared for medical emergencies by getting trained in car-\ndio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of an automatic external defibril-\nlator (AED), and by having an AED at the gym. Most states require this by law, and\nCrossFit trainers and affiliates should ensure they are in compliance with all state\nlaws. CPR/AED credentials often last for one or two years depending on the orga-\nnization (e.g., Red Cross, American Heart Association), and trainers should keep\nthem current.\nHYDRATION\nDrink when you are thirsty, do not when you are not.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 155 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nResponsible Training, continued\nWe advise against rehydration strategies that encourage consumption of fluids to\nprevent loss of body-weight during activity. Dehydration during physical activity is\na normal physiological process, and the thirst mechanism is sufficient in regulating\nhydration and serum sodium concentration during exercise.\nDrinking beyond thirst in an attempt to prevent body-weight loss during exercise\noffers no benefit to health or performance. It also presents a serious risk of ex-\nercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), a potentially deadly dilution of the body\u2019s\nserum sodium concentration. EAH is caused by overconsumption of fluid and can\nbe viewed as an iatrogenic condition due to the prevailing belief that exercising\nathletes should drink \u201cas much fluid as tolerable\u201d during training.\n\u201cFluid\u201d that can contribute to EAH includes electrolyte-enhanced sports drinks.\nContrary to popular belief, these commercial beverages do not reduce risk of hy-\nponatremia. Because of flavoring and sugar content, these drinks might present\ngreater risk for overconsumption of fluid than water alone, increasing the risk of\npotentially deadly EAH in athletes.\nSPECIAL POPULATIONS\nAny potential athlete with a medical condition needs to be cleared by a physician for\nexercise before a trainer recommends a fitness regimen. A medical-history form can\nbe a useful tool for a trainer to assess any potential issues, although trainers are also\nencouraged to ask questions regarding medical status and be aware of common\nmedical conditions that need clearance (e.g., diabetes, prescription medications).\nCommon special populations include pregnant athletes, and a trainer should still\nrequest medical clearance and guidelines from the physician once the condition is\nknown. The CrossFit Journal archive contains many resources regarding scaling for\npregnant athletes, such as the article \u201cPregnancy: A Practical Guide for Scaling.\u201d A\ntrainer should be especially aware of reducing the risk of potential falls in workouts\n(e.g., box jumps, rope climbs) and be observant for complaints of calf pain or swell-\ning, which can be signs of more serious issues.\nMany athletes have found improved recovery while staying active after surgery.\nWhile CrossFit workouts are indeed scalable for these athletes, trainers should\nseek clearance from the surgeon before restarting a workout regimen with them.\nA trainer\u2019s scope of practice allows promotion of any individual\u2019s desire to partic-\nipate in exercise and provision of direction; this does not extend to diagnosing or\ntreating any medical condition.\nLEGAL USE OF THE \u201cCROSSFIT LEVEL 1 TRAINER\u201d CREDENTIAL\nPassing the exam at the Level 1 Certificate Course earns an individual the desig-\nnation of CrossFit Level 1 Trainer, which can be abbreviated \u201cCF-L1 Trainer.\u201d The\nAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI), the third party through which the\ncourse is accredited, has approved this title.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 156 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

Those who pass the exam should not use the term\n\u201ccertified.\u201d While the distinction in terminology appears minor, the use of \u201cLevel 1\nCertified\u201d is a misrepresentation of the credential and is not endorsed by Cross-\nFit. A \u201cCertificate Course,\u201d such as the Level 1 Certificate Course, is a course with\nlearning objectives and a test that is tied to those specific objectives. It includes\nboth an educational or \u201ctraining\u201d component as well as a test to determine if the\nparticipant has learned the course material. A \u201ccertification,\u201d such as the Certified\nCrossFit Trainer or Certified CrossFit Coach credential, is only a test with no edu-\ncational component. Certifications are designed to assess competency across an\nentire profession. Preparation work for the certifications is done on the applicant\u2019s\nown time and under his or her own guidance. In layman\u2019s terms, and in the case of\nthe CrossFit credentials, a certification generally demonstrates a greater scope of\nprofessional competency versus a certificate.\nThe CrossFit Level 1 Trainer credential may be used next to one\u2019s name similar to\nother educational credentials (e.g., M.S., R.N., D.C.). It may be used on a website\nwith a biography or on a business card. It does not allow use of the name \u201cCross-\nFit\u201d to market services (e.g., personal CrossFit training, CrossFit classes). To market\nservices, a trainer must first apply to run a CrossFit affiliate.\nDuring the Level 1 Course, participants were exposed to a large amount of knowl-\nedge. Much of it can be found elsewhere free to the public and is commonly known\nto or accepted by the fitness industry in some form. However, this knowledge is\nnot found so organized and packaged outside the Level 1 Course. This defines the\nCrossFit method. An individual can use the CrossFit method to train himself or her-\nself and friends and family without charge. However, to use the CrossFit name or\nlogo (i.e., the CrossFit brand) to market services, a Level 1 Trainer must affiliate. An\nindividual is not permitted to advertise, market, promote or solicit, in business or\nservice, without licensing the CrossFit name. Licensing the CrossFit name is called\n\u201caffiliation.\u201d More information regarding affiliation can be found on CrossFit.com.\nThe risk-to-benefit ratio for CrossFit participants is very low; however, it is also the\ntrainer\u2019s responsibility to maintain the low risk for his or her clients.

To get the last three tenths of a point, you must demon-\nstrate \u201crisk, originality, and virtuosity\u201d as well as make no mistakes in execution of\nthe routine.\nRisk is simply executing a movement that is likely to be missed or botched; original-\nity is a movement or combination of movements unique to the athlete\u2014a move\nor sequence not seen before. Understandably, novice gymnasts love to demon-\nstrate risk and originality, for both are dramatic, fun, and awe inspiring\u2014especially\namong the athletes themselves, although audiences are less likely to be aware\nwhen either is demonstrated.\nVirtuosity, though, is a different beast altogether. Virtuosity is defined in gymnas-\ntics as \u201cperforming the common uncommonly well.\u201d Unlike risk and originality,\nvirtuosity is elusive, supremely elusive. It is, however, readily recognized by the\naudience as well as coaches and athletes. But more importantly, more to my point,\nvirtuosity is more than the requirement for that last tenth of a point; it is always\nthe mark of true mastery (and of genius and beauty).\nThere is a compelling tendency among novices developing any skill or art, whether\nlearning to play the violin, write poetry, or compete in gymnastics, to quickly move\npast the fundamentals and on to more elaborate, more sophisticated movements,\nskills, or techniques. This compulsion is the novice\u2019s curse\u2013the rush to original-\nity and risk.\nThe novice\u2019s curse is manifested as excessive adornment, silly creativity, weak\nfundamentals and, ultimately, marked lack of virtuosity and delayed mastery. If\nyou have ever had the opportunity to be taught by the very best in any field you\nhave likely been surprised at how simple, how fundamental, how basic the instruc-\ntion was. The novice\u2019s curse afflicts learner and teacher alike. Physical training is\nno different.\nWhat will inevitably doom a physical training program and dilute a coach\u2019s effi-\ncacy is a lack of commitment to fundamentals. We see this increasingly in both\nprogramming and supervising execution. Rarely now do we see prescribed the\nshort, intense couplets or triplets that epitomize CrossFit programming. Rarely do\ntrainers really nitpick the mechanics of fundamental movements.\nI understand how this occurs. It is natural to want to teach people advanced and\nfancy movements.

But make no mistake: it is a sucker\u2019s\nmove. Teaching a snatch where there is not yet an overhead squat, teaching an\noverhead squat where there is not yet an air squat, is a colossal mistake. This rush\nto advancement increases the chance of injury, delays advancement and progress,\nand blunts the client\u2019s rate of return on his efforts. In short, it retards his fitness.\nIf you insist on basics, really insist on them, your clients will immediately recog-\nnize that you are a master trainer. They will not be bored; they will be awed. I\npromise this. They will quickly come to recognize the potency of fundamentals.\nThey will also advance in every measurable way past those not blessed to have a\nteacher so grounded and committed to basics.\nTraining will improve, clients will advance faster, and you will appear more ex-\nperienced and professional and garner more respect if you simply recommit\nto the basics.\nThere is plenty of time within an hour session to warm up, practice a basic move-\nment or skill or pursue a new personal record (PR) or max lift, discuss and critique\nthe athletes\u2019 efforts, and then pound out a tight little couplet or triplet utilizing\nthese skills or just play.

More than just the\nbackbone of CrossFit\u2019s strength and successes, it has been, we believe, the prima-\nry reason for our success.\nUsing this template, we built a practice that kept us both busy from roughly\n5 to 10 a.m. Monday through Saturday. That schedule produced a low-six-figure in-\ncome, which is really amazing given that we got to work together, with our friends,\nhaving a positive impact on people\u2019s lives, and keep afternoons free for family,\nrecreation, and study.\nTraining with the attention and commitment that we bring to our practice, though\nfun and immensely rewarding, is also draining, and five appointments per day is\nThe trainers who about all we could handle without an unacceptable drop in energy, focus, and,\nare running group consequently, professional standards.\nclasses without\nEventually, the demand for our training exceeded the time we were professionally\ngrowing into them\nable or willing to allot.

The first is space\u2013more ath-\nletes require more space to train, but, fortunately, the space required to train 10\npeople is not 10 times that required for one, and space adequate for one athlete\ncan serve three or four athletes well.\nThe second drawback is that the reduced trainer-to-trainee ratio can dilute the\nprofessional training standards that we have embraced. This natural dilution can,\nhowever, be compensated for by the trainer\u2019s development of a skill set that is only\nvery rarely found.\nTo run group classes without compromising our hallmark laser focus and com-\nmitment to the athlete, the trainer has to learn to give each member of the group\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 162 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nScaling Professional Training, continued\nthe impression that he is getting all the attention that he could get in one-on-one\ntraining, and that requires tremendous training skill.\nWe have seen this skill fully and adequately developed by only one path: gradually\nmigrating from one-on-one to group sessions. The trainers who are running group\nclasses without growing into them are typically not working to the professional\ntraining standards that we have described. They also seem to have an inordinate\ndifficulty filling their classes.\nThis is exactly how we built our group classes. After working for years at the limit\nof our one-on-one capacity, we started accepting new clients by doubling them up\nwith other one-on-one clients to form one-on-two appointments.\nWe introduced the shift to group classes by telling the existing one-on-one clients\nthat we had good news for them: \u201cYour training rate is going to go down and we\u2019re\ngoing to introduce you to a new friend.\u201d Where there was resistance to sharing the\ntime we asked for a trial period. It went swimmingly well.\nThe pursuit of\nWe structured payment so that a client who was paying, say, $75 per session would excellence is the\nnow be paying only $50. This drives the trainer\u2019s hourly revenue up and reduces\nheart of our business\nthe clients\u2019 costs per session. This prompted many to come more often. When our\nplan.\u201d\nschedules filled and it became necessary to bring a third person to each group, we\nbrought the individual rate to $40 per session, and again the trainer\u2019s hourly rose\n\u2014COACH GLASSMAN\nand the client\u2019s costs fell. With the addition of each new athlete to the session, the\nrates fall for the athlete and rise for the trainer, and it all works perfectly unless\nthere\u2019s a perceived reduction in attention.\nAll the demands on the trainer skyrocket in this situation however. Attention, en-\nthusiasm, voice projection, and engagement all have to escalate. It is an acquired\nskill\u2013an art, really. Our goal is to give so much attention and \u201cin your face\u201d presence\nto each participant that each is actually grateful that he did not get more attention.\nThe essential shift is that the level of scrutiny and criticism is ratcheted up along\nwith the rate of praise and input for each client. The trainer becomes extremely\nbusy. There is no way a new trainer can walk into this environment and do well.\n(Imagine the decline in standards for those trainers who are participating in their\nclasses while trying to lead them. We see this too often, and the training is always\nsubstandard.)\nWithin two years we had morphed our one-on-one practice to all group classes\nwithout increasing the number of hours we worked each week, although we both\nkept a couple of choice one-on-one clients. We charged $15 per class and aver-\naged 10 to 15 athletes per session.\nThis substantially raised our income. It also gave a much-noticed boost to the sta-\nbility of our practice. Seasonal fluctuations due to summer and Christmas vaca-\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 163 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

With a one-on-one practice, when three clients you see\ntwo or three times per week are, by coincidence, on vacation simultaneously, in-\ncome takes a hit. Not so with group classes.\nAt the same time we started converting our practice from one-on-one to group\nclasses we launched CrossFit.com. The launch of the website was motivated by\nthe same commitment to client and efficacy that motivated our training. We were\nlooking not to increase our revenues but to favorably impact more people with our\ntraining. The difference might seem inconsequential, but the public clearly knows\nthe difference.\nFigure 1. Free Markets Reward Those Who Achieve Excellence.\nThe group classes, the CrossFit.com website, the CrossFit Journal, our seminars,\nand our affiliate program were all introduced to bring more quality training to\nmore people. Each of these additions also increased CrossFit\u2019s value for every-\none involved. It was our original one-on-one clients who initially came to and\nbenefited from the group classes, subscribed to the journal, visited the web-\nsite, and attended the seminars. Every CrossFit expansion has served the en-\ntire community.\nWe are in pursuit not of money but of excellence. The difference, we believe, is the\ndifference between success and failure. The pursuit of excellence is the heart of\nour business plan.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 164 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC. All Rights Reserved.", "Trainer Guidance Level 1 Training Guide\nScaling Professional Training, continued\nMoney is, for many, elusive because markets are unknowable. But while markets\nare unknowable, excellence is obvious to most everyone, especially free, and\nlarge, markets.\nIf you can accept the three premises that:\n\u2022 Markets are largely unknowable\n\u2022 Excellence is obvious to everyone, and\n\u2022 Free markets reward excellence\nit becomes obvious that the most effective business plan comes from achieving\nexcellence and letting the market bring the money to you (Figure 1). The efficiency\nand effectiveness of this paradigm is breathtaking.\nWe have used the pursuit of excellence to guide our every move. For instance,\nwhen we were considering the last expansion of CrossFit Santa Cruz we could not\ndetermine whether it would be financially feasible or not. The variables were too\nnumerous and the assumptions too uncertain to convince any accountant of the\nwisdom of expansion, but when we asked the simple question, \u201cWill it improve\nthe quality of the programming and the training experience?\u201d the answer was a\nresounding \u201cYes!\u201d On expansion, the CrossFit Santa Cruz numbers tripled within\nsix months and the extra space allowed for some refinements and additions to our\nprogramming that would not have been possible otherwise.\nAs our seminars, journal, website, and affiliate program grew, we handed off the\ngroup classes to a new generation of CrossFit trainers who now cover most of the\noverhead costs of CrossFit Santa Cruz. This has afforded us time and opportunity\nto commit more energy and resources to new projects that support and develop\nthe CrossFit community.\nLevel 1 Training Guide | 165 of 255\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CrossFit, LLC.

This section helps participants learn the fundamentals of the first three:\nteaching, seeing, and correcting the nine foundational movements of the Level 1\nCertificate Course.\nThe nine foundational movements of the Level 1 Course are:\n\u2022 The Air Squat\n\u2022 The Front Squat\n\u2022 The Overhead Squat\n\u2022 The Shoulder Press\n\u2022 The Push Press\n\u2022 The Push Jerk\n\u2022 The Deadlift\n\u2022 The Sumo Deadlift High Pull\n\u2022 The Medicine-Ball Clean\nTeaching requires knowing the necessary points of performance for proper exe-\ncution, including set-up and finish positions. Seeing builds on this knowledge by\nrequiring the trainer to assess these points of performance (and deviation from\nthem) in real time. Correcting is the ability to improve a client\u2019s mechanics to better\nadhere to the points of performance.\nEach movement has at least two sections: 1) Points of Performance; and 2) Com-\nmon Faults and Corrections. Where applicable, some movements also have a third\nsection: 3) Teaching Progression. These progressions break complex movements\ndown into simple steps that focus on developing the primary points of perfor-\nmance in the full movement.\nThis section is not meant to serve as an exhaustive resource of all the knowledge,\nteaching progressions, or possible corrections when coaching movements.
